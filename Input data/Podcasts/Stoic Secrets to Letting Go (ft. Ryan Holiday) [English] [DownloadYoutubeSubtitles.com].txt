- Why is it that a 2,000
year old philosophy

suddenly becomes massively popular,

selling tens of millions of books,

and garnering millions of
adherence around the world

in the age of social media?

Why, when made more aware of
the problems of the world,

do people seem to be
more apathetic than ever?

And what keeps the world's most
prominent stoic up at night?

These are just a few of the questions

that we're gonna be touching
upon in today's episode

with my good old friend, Ryan Holiday.

Ryan Holiday is a 10-time
bestselling author,

marketing genius, and founder
of the Daily Stoic brand.

He's single handedly brought a school

of ancient Greek philosophy

to millions of new
people around the world.

He's been so successful at
marketing the philosophy

that his name has become
almost synonymous with it.

It's interesting because my books

have often been compared to stoicism,

and people often mistakenly assume

that my background is stoic philosophy,

and I'm pretty sure that's Ryan's fault.

So, thank you, Ryan.

This episode was fun for
two different reasons.

One is that I visited Ryan down in Texas

and we shot this in his beautiful studio.

We actually recorded two podcasts.

I was on his show,

"The Daily Stoic Podcast," in the morning,

and then we recorded this
episode in the afternoon.

By the way, that episode I did with Ryan

is also out today on his podcast feed

if you wanna go check it out.

The other reason it was fun

is because I've known
Ryan for about 10 years,

and he and I have an easy
rapport with each other.

In fact, I think he gets more
personal here in this episode

than I've ever heard him
get in public elsewhere.

As we talk about his family,
his regrets, his anxiety,

and how he continues to wrestle

with the question of how
to spend his time well.

But before we begin,

I'd like to ask that you take a second

and follow and review the show.

It helps us out immensely when
reaching out to new guests

and putting together new episodes for you.

All right, that's it.

On with it.

Here is Ryan Holiday.

- [Announcer] 20 million books sold,

zero fucks given.

It's "The Subtle Art of
Not Giving a Fuck Podcast"

with your host Mark Manson.

- What do you give too many fucks about?

- Ooh, I was gonna ask you
that question and I didn't,

but that is a good question.

Like most things,

I think that that's why you
wrote such a huge book about it,

but we all care about way too many things

that we care about.

When you have kids,

one of the things that
you care about a lot

that you know you shouldn't care about

is like how you come off, right?

Like, in public with your...

Like, every parent, you get
on a plane with your kids,

and you're just like,

"God, I hope they don't,
like, cry this whole flight.

Like, there's this thing of like,

you don't wanna be seen as a bad parent,

but then you're inherently at the mercy

of this like unpredictable,
autonomous person, right?

And then you add on top of that,

which is a new thing
for me, which is like,

I used to be able to just
go through the world as me,

just like as a random person.

And, like, fame is the wrong word,

but let's say I'm no longer anonymous.

And so being able to be
in public with my family

for all the unpredictability
that that entails,

and then this sense
that I'm being watched,

I just shouldn't care at all, right?

And I'm never glad afterwards.

Like, I'm so glad I
corrected that behavior

over and over again because like,

it really matters how much
noise you were making,

you know, as we walk down
the hallway in this building.

I find myself like in that
trap that all parents do

of like not wanting to
be seen as a bad parent,

and then the sense that I'm being watched

as a parent all the time.

And it's compounded by the fact
that I live in a small town

and the people know-

- Everybody knows everybody.

- So I just have,

like, I'm struggling
lately with just this sense

that I'm having to perform all the time,

and I wish I was just
more comfortable, like,

this is who I am.

I don't care what you think of me.

I think I also give a fuck too much

about things that are outside my control.

That's like the main one.

Just like needing things
to be a certain way

on a certain time.

Like, you know what I mean?

- Are you like a little bit

of like control freak type stuff?

- Control freak is-
- A strong term.

- Well, no, no.

What I would say is that it all depends

on what that's stemming from.

I think I would define myself
as a naturally anxious person,

and ritual, routine, structure, control

are always of trying to treat
or mitigate that anxiety.

- Gotcha.
- And so like,

I see it more like that.

- Do you think that's why
stoicism appealed to you so much?

- Of course.

- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Because anxiety doesn't serve you well.

It tortures you, it doesn't do anything.

And the idea that there's
a very ancient philosophy

that has something to say
about dealing with that,

that's other than like,

take this pill or, you
know, do this therapy.

- Yeah.
- I like that.

- I think there's an interesting
intersection of stoicism

and kind of the present cultural
moment with the technology.

You've said many times

that when you started writing
"The Obstacle is the Way,"

you accepted very early on, you know,

this is an obscure form
of ancient philosophy.

I don't expect this to
sell a ton of books.

I don't expect it to become a thing.

Yet, it did, and it is a huge thing.

And there are millions of
people who resonate with it

and now might even
consider themselves stoics.

Why do you think that is?

What is it about this moment?

Obviously, stoicism has been
around and it's been popular

in intellectual circles-

- Yeah.
- For centuries.

But what is it about today that the masses

are resonating with it?

- Well, it is funny, right?

Because in retrospect,

it seems like obviously
it would be popular,

like, because it is popular, right?

And so, so sometimes people criticize me

or they go like, you know,
he popularized this thing

or he cashed in on this thing as like...

So I wrote "Trust Me, I'm Lying,"

which had gotten a very big advance

for being a 25-year-old who'd
never written any books.

And then when I had the idea
for "The Obstacle is The Way,"

my publisher offered me $75,000,

which is not nothing.

That's like, obviously,
that's a lot of money,

but you have to go,
that's several years work.

- Yeah, for people not familiar
with the publishing world,

that's not that much.

- Yeah, it's the kind
of advance they give you

because it's easier than saying no.

Like, they didn't wanna...

They didn't wanna lose me as an author,

so that was the least amount

of money they could give me without

hurting my feelings or
driving me to someone else.

And my editor told me this later.

She was like, "We hoped
you would do this book.

It would not work,

and then you would go back
to doing marketing books."

Because they're a business imprint.

So like, not only do I remember that,

but that's how I went into putting it out.

And I think it sold like three

or 4,000 copies its first week.

You know, like, not nothing.

Again, if you're comparing
this to a self-published author

or some, you know, like starving artist

who put out their first
novel, this is all great,

but like, it was not what it is now.

- It is not even a blip
on the radar today.

- Yeah, I mean, there are days

when it sells that many copies, you know?

- Yeah, yeah.
- Many days.

So I went into it
thinking like, if I could,

like, I knew for instance,

like, Machiavelli

and Sun Tzu had been made
popular for business audiences

in the '80s and '90s.

And like, I'd fallen in love
with stoicism and I thought,

"Well, maybe there's a market

for this ancient philosophy in this..."

That was like the most I was hoping for.

- Interesting.

- And so the freedom of low expectations

is a really important thing.

That's why I try not to have goals.

If you have goals that
are outside your control,

like, you need to sell this,

or your company needs to
make, you're just like,

it's just an arbitrary target.

And you're better off just
like seeing where it goes.

And the funny thing is,

if I had had any kind
of goal remotely close

to what it ultimately done,

it would've been because

I was a delusional entitled asshole.

Do you know what I mean?

Like, if I could have said,

"Hey, I'm doing this book
about an obscure school

of ancient philosophy,

and I'm hoping it'll
sell millions of copies

and set in motion like a series of books.

Like, you would've been like,

"This person's insane."

- [Mark] You're out of your mind, yeah.

- So the freedom of low
expectations is a big part of it.

But I think the reason it resonated

is the reason that stoicism
has always resonated.

And it's not fair to say
it's an obscure school

of age of philosophy, really,

because all schools of
philosophy are obscure, right?

But for thousands of years,

like, real people doing real
shit have said like, you know,

"Have you ever read Marcus
Aurelius or Epictetus?"

These have been like the
kind of underground, like-

- Yeah.

- It's like when people say that,

like, heavy metal is like underground,

but it's also enormous at the same time.

- Yeah.

Stoicism is like your
favorite intellectual's

favorite intellectuals.
- Yes.

And also the people who,

the favorite of the people
who are not intellectuals.

Like, it's the favorite of just,

they've only read one
philosophy book in their life.

This is one of those people.

Like, and so I think
what Stoicism speaks to

and is always spoken to
is this idea that like,

we don't control the world around us,

but we know we have some
control over ourselves.

And no one really tells us like

what we should or shouldn't be.

Like, this question of,

well, what's a good framework

or operating system
for like being a person

in this crazy fucked up world?

That to me, is what Stoicism is,

and it's kind of been refined
over thousands of years

of like, you know, here's
a way of thinking about it.

Do that.

You know, it's that.

- Yeah.
- That's really cool.

- Has your relationship
with Stoicism changed

since becoming so successful with it?

- Yeah.

I mean, look, stoicism as a philosophy

for dealing with adversity or, you know,

like, ordinary life is great.

And on the one end of
this spectrum of stokes,

you have like Epictetus, you
have Zeno who found stoicism

after the shipwreck where
he loses everything.

You have Cleanthes who was like,

basically a manual laborer
who worked in the gardens

of these rich people in Athens.

So like, it's always been
on that end of the spectrum.

There's been a ton that
stoicism can tell you like,

what to do when a tyrant
throws you into exile, right?

But on the other end of the spectrum,

stoicism has also really been popular

with extremely successful people.

Not that stoicism helps you be
extremely successful, right?

But like Marcus Aurelius is relying

on the same philosophy as Epictetus,

but their lives are as
different as they could be.

But there's a horseshoe
element to it of like,

the emperor is not as
free as you would think,

and the emperor is stressed

beyond you could possibly imagine

and tempted in all of these ways.

So I think like stoicism
as the books have worked

and I've done other stuff,

and stoicism as a philosophy
for dealing with that.

- Yeah.
- For dealing with ego,

for dealing with, you know, ambition,

for dealing with temptation,

for dealing with self-mastery.

Like, in a way, it's
almost more interesting

and more helpful I think.

- Yeah, because when you're
at the top of the totem pole,

there are no guardrails.
- Yeah.

- So, in many ways, it's harder to say no

to things than it is to
get out of adversity.

- It's easy to say no to things

you're not being offered.

- Exactly. That's a
good way of putting it.

- It's easier to not do things

that you're not in a position to do.

So you can imagine Marcus
Aurelius is like unlimited power.

So when he says, you know, he talks this,

there's beautiful passage of meditations

he is talking about.

He says, take care not to be Caesarfied

not to be stained purple.

Like, the only check on Marcus Aurelius

'cause the Senate at this time in Rome

is a ceremonial body almost entirely.

Like, the only check is Marcus Aurelius.

Like, he's the check on himself.

You could say the philosophy
is the check on him.

It's the final check and balance.

And so, yeah, I think, I
think I've relied on it more

than I did early, because
I don't know, early,

like, my life was pretty good, you know?

And not to say I didn't experience
adversity or difficulty,

but it's just like, it's a
different set of obstacles

when you achieve the things
that you wanna achieve.

sponsored by BetterHelp.

I've always said that
finding the right therapist

is by far the most
important part of getting

the most out of therapy,

but it's probably also one
of the hardest parts too.

That's where BetterHelp comes in.

make therapy accessible

and convenient for anyone, anywhere.

any way you want through text,

phone calls, or video chats.

Going to therapy was one
of the best decisions

I ever made in my personal life.

It helped me immensely
in my growth journey

and dealing with my emotional issues.

I can honestly say that
there's a good chance

that you wouldn't even be
listening to me right now

if I never went to therapy.

What do you give too few about?

- Ooh, what am I not care enough about?

- I feel like this is a
question to ask your wife.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, no.
(laughs)

I think if you're like a
creative introverted person,

you can kind of live in
your own world, you know?

And one of my favorite
novelists Walker Percy,

if you're ever in like the
movie goer or anything,

he talks about this problem
of reentry for creatives.

Like, you go out into this world

and you have to reenter the regular world.

And it's exacerbated by the fact

that a lot of the advice, you know,

for successful people is
like outsource everything.

It's almost like you're,
you design your life

to be this like pampered baby

that only does things you want to do.

And there's value in that.

Like, you know, you don't need to be like

changing your own oil if you
can pay someone to do it.

But at the same time,

like, this says something about me,

but it's taken work for me to be like,

"I'm only the main
character in my own life."

But if you are in relationships,

how I've had to consciously
give a fuck about just,

first-off, how my mood,
my decisions, whatever,

have consequences for other people.

And then also just,

although the temptation is there,

not designing your life where
everything revolves around you

and you only do the things you want to do,

- Would you say part of
that is being present?

- Definitely being present,

especially when you're working on a book

'cause you're always working on a book.

Like, there's some part of your brain

that's working on it all the time,

and how do you like
actually be where you are?

You get really good at
just following your mind

wherever it's taking you,

but that's not fair to a
three-year-old or to your spouse,

or it's not fair to the just
random person in front of you

that you're talking to.
- Yeah.

- So I think that, but
also just going like,

you took like a year off.

The justice book that I did
was finished in January of '23.

It was supposed to come
out in the fall of '23,

but I pushed it until June of this year.

And I just decided to just like,

just be kind of home and around more.

Like, I weirdly sort of
consciously just decided

to like, just do more
shit around my house.^

Like, I'm gonna do most of
the drop offs in pickups.

Just the division of labor in a house.

- Yeah.

- When, you know, you can
set it up in your favor

when you're the primary breadwinner,

when you have this thing
that's that no one else can do.

You know what I mean?

Like, and so just the decision to do that,

like, I decide to give a fuck about things

that I got really used
to never thinking about

because they took away from my main thing,

which was writing.

So the decision to be like,

I wanna be really good at what I do,

but I also want to be more

of a functioning person in the world.

- Yeah.

- Having worked really
hard at like, almost,

well, the word for it didn't really,

they call it weaponized incompetence.

Like, a lot of dudes do that
especially, just naturally,

but it wasn't so much that.

It's just like, if you're a
genius theoretical physicist,

just in the way of you're
a all star point guard.

They're just like, Ryan shouldn't
be booking his own travel.

Like Ryan, you know,

like, how do we make
things as easy as possible

for this star, you know?

And so you just get used to not caring

about things that are not that.

And I...

I don't know.

I just decided to care
more about that stuff.

- It's interesting,

every time I come and visit you out here,

it's incredibly impressive.

Like, you have constructed a life

between the bookstore,
the studio, the farm,

everything out here.

Like, it is so optimized

around what you're optimizing
for in your business

and in your life.

And from the outside, it's
incredibly impressive.

But a lot of people, I
don't know if people know,

but, you know, a lot of us
authors know each other.

- Yeah.
- You know, you, me,

James, Tim Urban,

like, we all known each
other for many, many years.

And it's funny 'cause the
conversation about you

when you're not around is like,

"Dude, does that guy do
anything other than write books?

Like, does he sleep?

Does he take a Saturday off?

Does he ever go to a movie?"

You know, it's like, your
level of productivity

and optimization is maybe the highest

of anybody I know, personally.

And that is a quasi compliment.

(both laughs)

- It's weird.

- But I guess what I'm getting at

is that it sounds like some of
this is the fallout of that.

- It's definitely the fallout of that.

But like, and the
pandemic was very helpful

because it just blew up
everyone's life, right?

And so it allowed me
to reset in some ways.

And I'm probably, if
my wife was listening,

she would maybe take some
umbrage with the idea

that some of these were
like decisions that I made.

- Yeah.
- As opposed to say ultimatums

and come to Jesus conversations.

Or just finally getting
things that have been,

someone who's been attempting

to communicate for a very long time.

- [Mark] Right.

- At the same time, I've always,

like, my wife and I have been
together since we were 20.

And I've never worked 20-hour days.

I've never pulled on...

Like, I've always been I think more rooted

and a homebody than maybe
people think that I was.

- Yeah.
- But like,

I work banker's hours,
and that's like generous.

Do you know what I mean?
Like, I got here today at nine

and I'm gonna pick my
son up at 3:30, you know?

And that's like a normal day for me.

So I do feel like I am
much more disciplined

and have better boundaries
than, like, a lot of...

First off, than most creatives

than I think people assume that
I do because of the output.

And to me that's because
I think a lot of people

are full of shit and they're
incredibly inefficient.

- Yes, you are incredibly efficient.

It's funny because we did
your podcast and we had lunch,

and you were like, "When
do you wanna do yours?"

And I was like, "15 minutes."

And you just disappeared.

Like, disappeared.

And I think... And this
is not a knock on you.

Like, this is... I've
known you a long time.

I'm like, "Oh, yeah, that's Ryan."

But like, probably every
other person I know

would probably still hang out at the table

and just shoot the shit for 15 minutes.

- Yeah.
- And...

(both laughs)
- I was trying to be...

I thought you would wanted some space.

I definitely did, but I also was like-

- Yeah, it's fine.

It's fine.

I'm not knocking you.

I mean, but it's funny 'cause it's,

if we were meeting for the first time,

I might be like, "What the fuck?"

But it's, I've known you forever.

I'm like, "Yeah, that's Ryan being Ryan."

So I could see when it
comes to being present,

being both physically and
mentally present with the family.

So how has that worked out?

- The improvements?

Or the, sorry, the change
that I'm talking about?

- Yes.

- I feel weird talking about the horrors

that was the pandemic of having
emerged from it much better

because like, it just...

I mean, first off, I didn't travel.

Like, we drove some places and
we had a little camper shows,

so, like, I wasn't like stuck in my house.

- [Mark] Sure.

- But, like, I didn't spend
the night apart from my family

for 500 days.

- Wow.

- Which is like the most I've never, like,

not gotten on an airplane,

probably in including my own upbringing.

- Yeah.
- Do you know what I mean?

And so it was like,

it was just a total reset.

In a lot of ways, that was amazing.

And it took out a bunch of stuff that,

I don't know, I just like
don't really do shit anymore.

Like, I don't like...

Austin Cleon when actually,

when I first moved here,
he told me he was like,

"Work, family, scene, pick two."

- Yeah.

- And I think about that all the time.

And so I basically don't
do the scene thing at all,

which has meant I pass on like
a lot of stuff that's cool.

Like, you know, I've been
offered like Super Bowl tickets

multiple times from
teams in the Super Bowl,

and I've said no.

Like, I be cool to do that.

Or it's like, "We're
all going hella skiing.

Do you want to come?"

Or like, you know, just, like,

I turned down like cool stuff

because I understand
it's coming at the cost

of the two more important things for me.

- Is that hard?

- I would say it's hard in some ways,

and it's easy because
I think I'm naturally

pretty introverted and
I also like my life.

- Yeah.

- It's hard in the sense that there's...

I know my life has been
changed by random things

that I said yes to, right?

But it's easier when you
start to make a habit of it.

Like, I imagine for you
when you took your year off,

when you decided to take a year off

and then you started saying no to things.

It becomes the default.

And then when it's the
default, it's great.

The problem is the default for most of us,

most of the time is yes.

- Yeah.

- But I would say like,
I think two things.

I talked about this

in the afterward of the
"Justice" book a little bit.

Like, the hardest part
was not the changes,

the hardest part was you make the changes,

and then you can't make the changes

and not have to face the implications

of how self-absorbed or selfish

or unbalanced it was previously.

Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

- And this is the other thing.

Like, this generation of people

spends, like, more time with their kids

than the last generation,
and the last generation,

and the last generation.

So, that's all great,

but another way to think
about it instead of like,

"How were men back then?"

is like what were men
missing out on back then.

- Right.

- So that's another bit
of cognitive dissonance

that can be painful when you go,

"Oh, I didn't do these things

because I thought it would affect me

professionally or whatever."

- Yeah.
- And then you change,

and it doesn't affect you professionally.

And you go, "So what was I doing it for?"

- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

Like, you would think it'd be like,

"Hey, I'm suddenly gonna be home more

and I'm gonna do more stuff

and I'm gonna take on these things."

You know, like, nobody
throws you a parade.

They're like...
(Mark laughs)

They're like, "Where
the fuck have you been?"

- Yeah.

- And also like...

Like, I get this when I...

Like, if I travel,
like, I go to do a talk,

and then I come home,

sometimes my wife goes like,

"You understand, like,
nobody hit pause here,

and then you have to
re-enter into this thing."

- Yeah.
- Right?

And so, like, the implication being like,

the idea that you can just
come and go as you please,

you can only maintain that

if you decide you're the
center of the universe,

which you're not.

- I can relate to that.

You know, my reset showed
me a lot of the same things

of how when the default becomes no,

there are all these opportunities
that when you took them

you thought they were so valuable

and oh my god, this is a
once in a lifetime thing.

And then when you start passing them up,

you realize like, "Oh, it's nothing."

"It doesn't mean anything."

- I think the one I still
struggle with is this.

You have this insecurity

mixed with this sort of
like scarcity mindset

mixed with this idea
that the musical chairs

are gonna stop at some point.

- Yes.
- Which they are,

but every time you turn down
an offer to do something,

part of what's preventing
you from turning it down

is the belief that it's the last time

you're gonna be offered that thing.

- Yeah.

- That you're not gonna be sitting back

at the end of the year and go,

"This year was way busier than last year.

I did more than last year.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- I still struggle with that a lot.

So it's so hard for me to say no.

That part of why I live
here and have set up my life

and I have a reputation is
so I just get asked less.

- Yeah.

- What I don't know
about can't give me FOMO.

- This episode is brought to you by AG1.

I've been taking AG1 since like 2018.

I don't even remember.

It's been so long.

I first gave AG1 a try because,

well, I heard them sponsored
just about every podcast

I ever listened to,

so I figured, "Why the fuck not?"

And I'm glad I did
because AG1 is a pleasant

and easy way to get all
of my daily vitamin needs.

That's because AG1 is a
foundational nutrition supplement

that supports your body's universal needs

for gut optimization, stress
management, and immune support.

Not only does AG1 replace a multivitamin,

but every scoop includes
prebiotics, probiotics,

and digestive enzymes for gut support.

AKA that means my morning
shits are awesome.

Even some of my employees
started drinking AG1,

and they always tell me

that it supports their gut health too.

But then again, maybe
they just tell me that

because I pay them.

If you wanna take
ownership for your health,

it starts with AG1.

Try AG1 and get a free one year supply

of vitamin D3, K2,

and five free AG1 travel
packs with your first purchase

by going to drink AG1.com/idgaf.

That stands for I Don't Give a Fuck.

Drinkag1.com/idgaf.

Check it out.

You mentioned in passing
kind of a sense of lament

or struggling with feelings
of guilt or regret.

Would you describe that as a regret?

- Yeah.

I mean, it's a regret,

there's guilt, there's a sense that,

I don't know I would
think about it actually.

Yeah, I think I'd think all those things.

It's just....

It's my favorite thing.

And how often I prioritize things

that were not even close to
my favorite thing to do that,

do you know what I mean?

And when the stuff went
away, I didn't miss it.

- Yeah.
- But I would miss this.

But then why do you choose that thing

over the other thing?

- I think it's interesting to me because,

and this is a drum I bang on quite a bit,

which is that self-improvement
is often accompanied

with a lot of negative feelings.

Guilt, regret, shame.

And it comes in different forms.

Like, sometimes you have to
like grieve an old identity.

- Yeah.
- And in this case,

you almost have to grieve
a life you could have had

or a time you could have had, but didn't.

- Yeah, Epictetus'

"The philosophy classroom
is like a hospital

because you weren't well when you entered.

Like, you're saying you're sick.

You came to it because
something wasn't working.

You weren't who you wanted to be,

you weren't what you
were capable of being.

When you do this work on yourself,
you find like assumptions

or decisions you are making
or patterns that you're in.

And most people come
face to face with that,

and then decide to double down

or deny it or blame other people,

and then there's the other path

where you have to wrestle
with it and deal with it.

And, like, you can't do
anything but make amends for it,

you can't do anything but try
to be different in the future,

or just grieve what could
have been that wasn't.

Again, I don't feel like,

I wasn't terrible at it, you know, but-

- It's not like you were
deadbeat dad. (laughs)

- No, no.

And yeah, I'm not like coming belatedly,

but it's just more like,
even though I was doing,

it's like I was doing the large
building blocks were there,

you know, I was never like,

"Oh, I was gone for a month
to do this thing or whatever."

But it just was, just like
not fully understanding

how much of the load of what
you do is born by other people.

And the decision to be like,

I'm gonna try to deal as
much as I can with my own...

All you can really do in this life

is carry your own fucking weight.

- Yeah.

- And the decision to see where you are

haven't been carrying your own weight

and carry that weight is
like the starting point.

And then hopefully

you can also help other
people with theirs.

But that's kind of how I've
been thinking about it.

- What do you think most people
give too many fucks about?

- Oh.

Yeah, I mean, I think
most people care too much

about the things that
other people told them

they should care about.

This is Rene Girard, right?
- Yeah.

That "We don't know what we want,

so we want what other people want."

And they don't really stop and go,

"Here's what makes me happy.

Here's what lights me up."

And because they haven't done
that work, they're just like,

"Well, what seems to
light other people up?

What are the things that are important?"

You just end up trying
to like win these races

where, first off, maybe the
outcome isn't really up to you,

and then the outcome is
like not great, you know?

Like, how many people become lawyers

because they don't know what
they wanna do with their life?

Even though like the data is very clear

on how unhappy lawyers are, right?

And so I think that's a big one,

is like people just,

they don't really know what to
care about or not care about,

and so they kind of just default

to like whatever they fell into

or whatever seems a lot
of people care about.

And the real problem with
that is that by definition,

that's the most competitive stuff.

So when you're kind of
doing your own thing

and you set your life
up in the unique way,

that is only possible for you,

chances are, you're not
fighting for, you know?

Like, if you live in New York City

'cause that's where you heard people

like you are supposed to go,

I don't think it's a surprise to go like,

it's more expensive to live there

'cause a lot of people wanna live there.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- But if actually you're uniquely suited

to live in Gary, Indiana,

you're gonna find out it's very easy

to live in Gary, Indiana.

I mean, you're paying for it another way,

but the point is,

you don't understand
you're paying a premium

in, say, rent or taxes for a
thing that you're not getting.

Now, if New York is the
only place in the world

for someone like you, or San Francisco

is the only place for the
person, or Paris or whatever,

then by all means,

gladly pay what it costs to do that thing.

But are you sure that's the thing for you?

- I love this topic because it's,

part of it I think is
just necessarily human.

Like, if you look at young people,

like, the way you learn
anything is you mimic and adopt

the scripts and narratives and skills

and behaviors that other people exhibit

and try to mimic them yourself,
adopt them for yourself.

The next step after you've
done all that, you know,

that is in a sense what education is.

It's just taking all of
civilization's knowledge

and forcing young people to mimic it

until they understand it

or can behave in the appropriate ways.

I think what probably most people

never get to the point of doing

is just realizing that
those are simply scripts

and narratives that were handed down

through the generations

and that you don't
necessarily have to follow it

and that you probably should
question each of those things.

And it's fine if you question it

and decide to come back to it, you know?

It's like, mom and dad raised you

in a certain religion or culture.

You deviate, you question it,
you experiment outside of it,

you decide, "No, I like
mom and dad's way,"

and you come back to it.

But I think that experimentation

outside of whatever
your default script is,

is so important from just like
a self-esteem perspective.

Because when you do come back to it,

at least now you know,

"I tried the other thing, wasn't for me.

Mom and dad had it right all along."

And then you can like live
in that with confidence.

You don't have to like
put blinders on and-

- Yeah, you gotta learn the
rules before you break them.

But my sister-in-law said
something to me once.

She was talking about
how she had always been

like scared to drive at night.

Like, she didn't like driving at night.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- And then she was
saying that she realized

that actually her mom was
scared to drive at night.

Like, this was just a
thing that she just heard.

Mom was scared to drive at night.

Mom talked a lot about it's
dangerous to drive at night,

always made dad drive at
night, whatever, right?

So it just became this
like inherited assumption

as part of her worldview,

but like had never actually challenged it

or said like, "Is this true for me?"

Now, it could be ultimately
that it is true for her,

but in that moment, it wasn't.

And she was just
realizing that it was like

an inherited unquestioned assumption.

And we all do this, right,

'cause stuff happens
to us in our childhood.

As I understand it,

you have these things that
happen in your childhood,

or you're neglected,

you have some problem in your childhood,

and you come up with some childish way

of addressing that feeling
or distress or pain.

They call this the adaptive child, right?

And then you become an adult

and you have to ask yourself like,

"Am I being the adults or am
I being the adapted child?"

And I think a lot of
people give a lot of fucks

or care a lot about things

that are about coping with
assumptions or environments

that they're no longer in.

Or that they're on paths
that were set up for them

by their parents or their culture

or even just like the era they grew up in,

and they haven't stopped in

at this really essential
question, which is,

"Is this still true and is
it true to me personally?"

And so those are really powerful questions

and you can free yourself
of a lot of baggage.

And it doesn't have to
be judgmental, right?

It could just be like,
this was true at the time,

this is what I thought or
what I needed when I was 15,

it's what I needed when I was 25,

it's what I needed when I was 35,

but, like, that's not me anymore.

And so I don't have to
care about that stuff.

- You know, my marriage,
especially marrying somebody

from a completely different culture,

there's so many times
throughout my marriage

where we'll like get into
an argument about something,

and ultimately the root of the issue

after like going around
in circles for 30 minutes,

the root of the issue is simply

we have different
definitions of the same word.

Like, her idea of clean

is different than my idea of clean.

Or her idea of saving money

is different than my idea of saving money.

And until we actually,
like, get to the point

where we can look at our definitions

and ask ourselves like, "Well,
is that a good definition?"

"Is my definition good?"

"Okay, yeah, no, my definition

actually probably doesn't make sense."

Or "Let's find a compromise definition."

- [Ryan] Yeah.

- I feel like so much of
a relationship conflict,

and actually probably the healing part

of relationships as well

is renegotiating the meaning

of a lot of those narratives and stuff.

- Was it my opinion that was driving it

or was it, "Hey, I want
to do this this way,

or I think it should be this way

or it should be this
many times or whatever.

It was that actually based
on like my needs and desires

or my sense of what my
needs and desires would be

or how I would feel if someone
else knew about it," right?

So it comes back to this
Girardian thing of like,

"Is this what you're after

or is it what you feel
like you should be after

or how you saw it in your household?"

And the ability to sit down and go like,

"Well, what do I really believe

what's actually important to me?

What are my needs?

How do I want things to go?

Are we actually totally in agreement here

and there's just some like external noise

that's adding pressure on this situation?"

And then you can kind of reset.

Do you know the Kurt Vonnegut thing

where he says all fights in marriages

can be boiled down to this one idea,

which is that you are
saying to that other person

you're not enough people?

(Mark laughs)

And I think that's totally true.

He was commenting primarily on the sort

of the idea of the nuclear family.

That, you know, people used to live

in these extended networks,

and the spouse wasn't asked to do so much.

And I think you could say,

"Yeah, you're not enough people."

And then also like, a
lot of 'em are rooted in,

a lot of the arguments in spouses

are rooted in assumptions

that neither of you actually believe

but have just gotten used to insisting on

or thinking is what you want.

- There's an inertia that happens

with values and beliefs.

And the nuclear family
thing is interesting.

I had David Brooks on the
podcast and he talked about that.

- He's great.
- Yeah.

It was amazing conversation.

He talked about how
the idea of two parents

and X number of kids is
like a really recent idea.

- And that both of them would be employed,

like, full-time something?

- That's a super...

That's like a two-generation idea.

And he pointed out that like,

it might be unreasonable to expect

all of your needs and
wants to be fulfilled

or all of the duties and
expectations to be fulfilled

by like a singular person.

Whereas in the past,

there was probably like siblings, in-laws,

aunts, uncles, you know,

either in the house or in the neighborhood

who could, like, take
off some of that load.

- Yeah, and we're asking
both parents to do

way more than they've ever done before

in the sense that like,
families used to be, like,

pretty okay with like a
couple of the kids dying.

(Mark laughs) Do you know what I'm saying?

Like-

- We need to go back to that.

No, I'm just-

- I'm joking, I'm joking.
- It'd be like, you know,

like, when you read history

and you read about like
the incredible amount

of preventable deaths-

- Yes.

- I mean, I'm saying it's
way better that we....

But it is a like a lot,
do you know what I mean?

Like, I was just reading some book.

I forgot what it was

and it was like the mom
had to go do something

so she just like left
her kids that are my age

just like in the cabin by
themselves for like two weeks,

you know what I mean?

You would never...

You would get arrested and
spend like years in jail

if you did that.

- Oh, I've seen multiple news stories

of parents getting
arrested that I was like,

"My parents did that," you know?

- Yeah, of course.

- Like, leaving a kid at
home overnight, you know?

Playing outside until like 9:00 PM like...

- Yeah, yeah.

And I'm not saying that that's
like the way it should be.

I'm just saying like,

we're now expecting people
to do more with less.

- And I think it's an
unreasonable expectation.

- Agreed.

- I think it's...

We've maybe overcorrected.

This episode is brought
to you by Tim Ferriss.

Yes, that Tim Ferriss.

Tim is celebrating 10 years
in podcasting this year.

And so he reached out to a
bunch of his former guests

with podcasts and asked to
sponsor us for the week.

What a good guy.

What a good guy, Timmy.

Such a good guy.

So I go back a long way with Tim.

I read his book "4-Hour Work Week"

when I was like 23 or 24
and stuck in a dead end job.

It inspired me to quit
and start my first website

and set me onto my current career path.

I know I've sometimes been critical

of the propensity to try
to optimize everything,

but Tim has long been a giant

in internet media, in the podcast space.

And the truth is, is that
honestly he has blazed the trail

that so many of us have
been able to walk down.

So here's to you, Timmy.

Not only is it 10 years,

but he's also just crossed
1 billion podcast downloads.

That is fucking insane.

And if you haven't listened to a show,

do yourself a favor and check it out.

It's called The Tim Ferriss
Show on any podcast app.

Or you can go to his website, Tim.blog.

He's had some pretty huge
guests on over the years.

LeBron James, Hugh Jackman, Jamie Fox,

this weird guy named Mark Manson.

You know, just some of
the highest performing

and most impressive people on earth.

So, thank you, Tim.

Best wishes to you brother.

And here's to another 10 years

and another billion downloads.

Last question.
- Oh, okay.

- What do most people
give too few fuck about?

- Well, I just,

thinking about this with
the book that I'm doing now.

I think most of us give too few

about basically anyone but ourselves.

So, we care way too much about
like what other people think

and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

And then we are very indifferent

to the vast amounts of
preventable suffering

that are happening in the world.

Like, so Peter Singer, the ethicist,

the ethical philosophers
like premise is like,

"Okay, if you were like walking to work

and you saw a child drowning
in a puddle in front of you,

you would obviously not allow that.

You would not jump over them

because you didn't want to
get your like clothes dirty."

But like some version of that is happening

all over the world constantly.

And a lot of it is like quite affordable

to make a substantial
indent in doing this.

We're talking about like malaria nets

or, you know, whatever.

So, I feel like we just don't care a lot

about what's happening to other people.

The pandemic was obviously
a huge example of this,

where like for a couple weeks,

we were kind of all on the same page.

And then although we were
arguing about this or that,

fundamentally, one segment
of society was arguing

with another segment of society

as to why they should give a shit

about how their actions
affect other people.

That's obviously horrendous, you know?

You think about something
like the opioid crisis,

which is this devastating,

slow moving, like, human catastrophe.

It's not like it's this
totally unprecedented thing.

Almost exactly as the
opioid crisis was beginning,

the crack epidemic was ending.

And America specifically decided
to see the crack epidemic

as like a moral failing of
a certain group of people

or segment of society or as
primarily an inner city problem.

- [Mark] Right?

- Had we decided instead to go like,

"This is a public health crisis.

"And if one community is threatened,

potentially, all other
communities are threatened

and decided to figure out as a society

what you do about addiction

instead of just criminalizing drug use

and like locking people up

or ignoring that it's
happening altogether,

you know, maybe we would've
been in a better position

to do something when a much
more potent drug epidemic

happens that affects like everyone.

Do you know what I mean?
- Totally.

- And so I think you shouldn't
care what other people think,

you shouldn't care about things

that are outside your control.

At the same time, cultivating a sense

about the validity and dignity

and sacredness of life itself.

You know, I think Albert
Schweitzer had this expression,

I think he would say it in French,

but it was like a reverence for life.

Like, just caring about life

is probably what we don't
give a shit enough about.

- There's a lot to dig into there.

I want to go back to
this Peter Singer thing.

- Yeah.

- So on your podcast a couple hours ago

we were discussing moral philosophy

and how it's one thing
to toil theoretically

with moral questions

and another one entirely to
think about implementation.

And I think about the
Singer thing and I'm like,

"Okay, yes, from a moral point of view,

a kid drowning 10 feet in front of me

and a kid starving to death
in Africa or wherever,

morally, those two things are equivalent.

And yes, in a perfect
system, in a perfect world,

if I can just pay 10 bucks

and save that kid in Africa's
life, I should do that.

I think what gets lost in that,

and I don't have a high conviction.

Like, my beliefs on this
are not high conviction.

So there are coordination problems,

there are executive and
administrative problems.

How does that $10 get there?

Who is spending it?

Where are they sourcing it?

How does that sourcing affect
other parts of the economy

in that area?

Of that $10, how much is
actually making it to the kid

and how much is, you know, going to like,

you know, some NGO in
Switzerland or something.

Again, in theory, I agree wholeheartedly.

I think we had a whole
conversation earlier

about how the trickiness of moral problems

is almost always in the implementation.

And I would argue that with
things like the pandemic,

the opioid crisis, and maybe
even the crack epidemic,

obviously, there are some horrible people

who just don't give a shit

and they're very cynical
and callous about it.

But maybe I'm naively optimistic,

but I feel like the opioid crisis,

I think there's probably
almost universal agreement

that it's a horrible, tragic thing,

yet seemingly nothing is
really being done about it.

And when I look at why,

I think it's in those questions
of administrative systems,

you know, how are things executed,

what are the implementations of it?

Like, there's probably
a network of systems

that are so inter interlaced
and tied up in each other

that to get anything to
move or change is like,

- Oh, I totally agree.

And look, there's so many problems

with the effective altruism,
not just philosophically,

but practically as we have seen,

I do think it's illustrated

that like effective altruism
is like a recent invention.

Like, we've been obviously generous

for thousands of years,

but no one was ever like,

"How do we actually get good at this?"

You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- So I'm just saying,

look, they're obviously like psychopaths

and sociopaths who don't
care about other people,

and then there's people who think

that just caring about
other people is enough.

And that...

So, both ends of the spectrum.

I don't know if I would totally
agree that most people care.

I would argue there is this
impulse in every human being

to look at a problem that
is happening in the world.

And the mind is very good
at looking at that thing

and trying to figure out a way
that you can say to yourself,

this is either not a problem

or it's not my problem.
- Not my problem, yeah.

- And that's sort of
what I'm talking about.

The idea that because
someone's different than you,

they live differently than you,

they have different beliefs than you,

when we make decisions
or we put in policies,

they affect people.

Like, now someone can't get IVF,

now someone can't worship the
faith that they wanna worship.

Or, you know, like,

so again, it's across
the political spectrum,

but thinking about how
the decisions you make

or the views you have
land on other people,

presumably people you will never

meet and know nothing about,

that to me is something
we could use more of.

We should care less about
a whole bunch of things

that don't really matter.

And that's a thing that
really does matter.

- So Derek Thompson published a piece

just I think a few days
ago about a new study

actually done by, it's really interesting,

a Danish political scientist
did a study on American voters,

which I love.

It was really interesting what he did.

So, he intentionally put
out fake conspiracy theories

about both Republicans and
Democrats on social media,

and then he tracked who shared what,

who liked what, who did whatever.

The expectation obviously
was that Republicans

were gonna like and share

conspiracy theories about Democrats,

and Democrats were gonna like and share

conspiracy theories about Republicans.

Was not what happened at all.

What he found was that there
were a minority of Democrats

and a minority of Republicans
who shared everything.

- Yeah.
- So it was basically like,

90% of people just don't give a shit

about conspiracy theories,
they see 'em for what they are,

and then there's 10% of people

regardless of party who share all of them.

So the Democrats shared
conspiracy theories

about Hillary Clinton

just as much as they
shared conspiracy theories

about Donald Trump.

And he actually went and
interviewed these people.

And his conclusion was that
there was a small subset

of people in the United States

who seem to just have this need for chaos.

- Yeah.

Some people just wanna
watch the world burn.

- That's exactly what it is.

That they have given up
hope on the system entirely,

that they have no illusions

that it's ever gonna do anything for them,

either party, no matter what,

and they just wanna sow chaos, which...

Yeah, that scares the shit out of me

because I don't know how
you retrieve those people.

- No, I don't know if you can.

The ease with which people can
be infected by those people

or those people can care so much

that other people who are
busy and generally do care

go like, "It's not worth it."

- Right.
- Do you know what I mean?

Like, it's just, this is a morass of,

this is an unending, unwinnable battle.

I'm just gonna focus on other shit.

And when you don't really understand

sort of like how civil
rights movement happened,

you forget like, reconstruction ends

because the South realized

that although the North could
beat the South in a civil war,

it could not perpetually occupy the South

and it wasn't prepared to
win a battle for the hearts

and minds over this issue,

which the issue was not whether
we could own people or not.

Ultimately, it was whether the country

was really predicated on the idea

that all men were created equal.

And the South just realized
if we lynch enough people,

if we sow enough chaos, if
we cause enough trouble,

eventually the North's will will collapse.

And at some point, they'll
need something from us,

and we'll be able to
negotiate a compromise

where we get to not reinstate slavery,

but protect enough of the status quo

that we can live with it.

So then, like, when
you watch these videos,

like, during the civil rights movement

of, like, the fire hoses
and the beatings and the,

you go, "How did they
think this was gonna go?"

Like, what they knew was,

"Hey, if we're awful enough

and we make it hard enough to enact

these federal laws at the
state and local level,

Democrats won't be in office forever,"

you know what I mean?

Or like, one of us will win the presidency

or just people will get tired
and move on to the other...

They just knew that eventually
they would give up, right?

And so I think the problem is,

like, the crazy awful chaos
agents, cynics, whatever,

it's like an asymmetry where they know

that if they just make it
hard enough, painful enough,

you know, exhausting enough,

you'll just go back to
your own life, right?

And so it's not just
that you have to care,

you have to, like, really care.

Like, to wrap your head around

the sustained interest
and commitment it took

to abolish the slave trade to...

The women's rights movement
took like 70 years.

Like Seneca Falls to the
passage of women's suffrage

is like 70 years,
something like that, right?

And like it took forever.

And every fucking state
in every fucking city

was this massive battle

over an issue that's obviously morally,

you know, clear in retrospect.

But like, it wasn't like
some people really cared

and some people didn't care.

But like, if you want to make

any kind of moral difference in the world,

you have to care like
to an incredible degree.

So this is also why you have to pick

which fucks you care about.

Like, you know, do you
care about, like, pronouns

or do you care about,

like, you know, legal protections and...

You know what I'm... So you
have to pick your battles.

But, I don't know.

I don't mean to sound like
I'm on some high horse,

but it's just what I've
been thinking about a lot

and realizing like,

what alarms me about the world

that I'm bringing my kids into,

but also what I see is
just like, it's not apathy,

but it's almost like an
energizing of awfulness.

I don't know.

I probably took this way far off.

(Mark laughs)

- Ryan Holiday, everybody,

in his high horse.

- You can read about this

in my worst selling book,
"The Stoic Virtue of Justice."

- What is the justice book called?

- "Right Thing, Right Now."

- Okay.

- And then the subtitle, which
I've gone back and forth,

you tell me if you hate it

'cause the ink is not dry,

but it's, "Right Thing, Right Now:

Good Values, Good Character, Good Deeds."

- It's not bad.

- Ideally, you want something
better than, not bad,

but I'll take it.
(both laughs)

- It's not terrible.

- I don't hate it.

- Yeah, yeah.

I'm not gonna be, you know,
whistling it to myself

when I drive back.

But, you know, it will suffice.

How is that for a pro?

- I'm actually gonna put that on my cover.

- Yeah, Ryan Holiday's new
book, "It Will Suffice."

(Mark laughs)

- Not terrible.

- Yeah, not terrible.

I've read worse.

- As far as the title goes.
I thought it was okay.

- No, I like it.

It's catchy.

It's got little Van Halen thing going.

- Oh, yeah.

♪ Right now ♪

You should get Sammy Hagar to, you know,

come on your book tour with you.

- You know, David Lee Roth is mentioned

as an offhand comment in the book,

and so as David Brooks.

So I have a chapter on
"The Second Mountain."

I climbed in "The Second Mountain."

And, you know, he just decided on a lark

to become paramedic in New
York City, like, for fun.

- Yeah, I remember that.

- And I just think, that's great,

more people should do that.

You should take your success.

And I taught English for
two years, or whatever.

Lou Gehrig after,

people know, like, Lou Gehrig

gets his baseball career, catcher,

he spends like the last
three years of his life,

he's the head of the New
York City parole board.

- Oh, wow.

- Like, he could have made
a fortune or done nothing,

like, you know, putting his name

on a nightclub or something.

Instead he just approves and denies,

like, rehabilitates criminals, basically.

- Wow, I wonder why he chose that.

- LaGuardia offers him a job,

and he wants to be of use.

And I think he,

probably exactly what David
Brooks is talking about

in "The Second Mountain," which is like-

- Which is like, he's a guy I swung a bat

and hit a ball my whole life.

I wanna do something that's meaningful.

- Yeah, and also I'm gonna die,

and so how am I paying back
what I've (indistinct) of.

- Cool.

- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, man.

- This was fun.

(upbeat music)
