- When I was young, pretty
much all of the marriage

and relationship advice
I heard boiled down to

wait as long as possible to do it.

Don't marry until you're 30.

Date as many people as you can.

Take care of yourself first.

Don't give up too much of yourself.

Date around.

Find someone who's perfect for you.

And if they're not perfect for you,

kick their ass to the curb
and move on with no regrets.

Now, statistics say that
the past two generations

have apparently taken
this advice to heart.

The marriage rate is at an all time low,

people are waiting longer
than ever to marry,

and people date more frequently

and date more people than ever before.

Non-monogamy is becoming a thing,

and the coup de grace, infidelity rates

have risen every decade stretching

all the way back, the free love '60s.

Now, with dating apps,
it's never been easier

to drop one person and
skip right to the next one.

Sorting people by your ideal checklist

of traits is standard
now, and the refrain of,

they weren't right for
you, you can do better,

has never been stronger.

Yet, if you dig into the
psychological literature,

the findings are clear.

Married people are
happier, they live longer,

they make more money,
they report more meaning

and satisfaction in their lives.

Being in long, boring,
stable relationships is good

for our mental health and happiness.

Yet the message to young people
seems to be the opposite.

Long-term relationships matter.

I didn't appreciate this
until I was well into my 30s.

I grew up with divorced parents
telling me not to settle,

to get my career and friends
and finances into order

before I found someone to share them with.

I dated around as much
as possible in my 20s,

and I dropped relationships,
both good and bad,

at the first sign of danger.

Now I look back and I wonder
if maybe I took things too far.

My guest today is Sadia Khan,

a psychologist and dating coach.

Sadia is a British Muslim, so she brings

an interesting perspective
from two different cultures

as well as her academic background.

She's unconventional in
that most of her advice

is stuff that my grandmother
probably would've said

if she were alive today.

Yet in the age of social
media, dating apps,

and abundant pornography,
Sadia's advice is, well,

it hits a little different than Nana's.

Let's just put it that way.

In today's episode, we discuss

how the skills that people develop

to maximize their dating
prospects are the same skills

that hinder their long-term
relationships and intimacy.

We talk about the relationship between

sex appeal and status, how
men and women who objectify

each other kind of deserve each other,

and how insecure men's simplistic views

of sex only makes them
feel even more insecure.

We talk about how most
women's dating advice

encourages outright
narcissism and entitlement,

and how this is only frustrating the women

in the long run rather than helping them.

We talk about how pornography
has skewed male expectations

of intimacy while social media has skewed

female expectations of intimacy,

and well, the disaster that
it's caused for everybody.

We talk about the relationship
between self-esteem and love,

and why insecure men
and women overcompensate

in all areas of their lives,
not just with each other.

We talk about why boundaries are actually

for other people's
benefit, not just yours.

And of course, we talk about
prostitutes, gold diggers,

and glory holes, you
know, the three pillars

of any good relationship podcast.

That and much, much more.

Drew joined me in studio for this one,

so it's a very special episode,

and please be sure to follow
the show, leave a review,

tell me and Drew how handsome we are.

It helps me get more guests for the show

and it helps Drew get more dates

and it's the best way to support us

and let us know that you love
all the juicy information

you got from the episode.

So without further ado, let's get into it.

- [Narrator] 20 million
books sold, zero fucks given.

It's "The Subtle Art of
Not Giving a Fuck Podcast"

with your host, Mark Manson.

- Welcome, Sadia.

This is the first in-studio interview

on "The Subtle Art of Not
Giving a Fuck Podcast."

Honored to have you as a guest.

- Extremely honored to be here.

I've been saying this online all the time.

I am the biggest Mark Manson fan.

You're the only content I refer to

when I'm double checking if
I've got something right.

So I'm like, what would Mark say?

Okay, let me double check.

Okay, he agrees.

Perfect, then I must be right.

- Well, flattery will get
you very far in this studio.

This is also a first.

Drew is joining us for the
first time on an interview.

We thought it would be fun

since you are a relationship expert.

- Yeah.

- I'm happily married for a long time.

He's happily single.

And so we thought it'd
be interesting to have

both perspectives and come
at it from both angles.

So we'll see where this goes.

I wanna start with, you had a spicy quote

that I saw recently, which was,
you said that modern dating

is training people for divorce.

What do you mean by that?

- You're practicing all the
skills and tools you need

to recover from a breakup,
to have disassociated sex,

and to look for very
extrinsic values in a partner.

So things that we would look
for in short-term dating,

like looks, sex, status, power,

and how to replace them
in case it goes wrong.

So we always go into dating
with an insurance policy

in case this person goes wrong, in case

there's somebody else out
there, in case I can do better.

With that mentality, we don't
practice any of the skills

and tools we need to maintain
a connection and therefore

we are going from relationship
to relationship rather than

learning anything that will
maintain the relationship.

We just learn how to recover
and replace people, sadly.

- Interesting, okay.

So there's a lot I think we can pull,

there's a few threads
there that we can pull at.

The first one that stands out to me is

that we're filtering for the wrong things.

We're filtering for kind of

the superficial, extrinsic traits.

Looks, status, sex.

Why do you think, is that the apps?

Like, what's driving that do you think?

- I would say the apps don't help

and I really don't like to
sound like a broken record,

but I think from a female
perspective, the extrinsic values

are really pulled from social
media and seeing a lifestyle

that they're constantly bombarded with.

So that's caused them to look
for more extrinsic values.

For men, I think
pornography has caused them

to look for very extrinsic values,

and that combination of women
that are looking for money

and men looking for sex
means that sex workers

and more promiscuous women are reaching

the most successful men
and they're pairing up

quite quickly and easily.

It doesn't last, but they're pairing up

quite quickly and easily.

But people who are actually
looking for intrinsic values

and looking for connection,
they're really struggling

in the dating market.

And so we have to look at where society's

made it easier for, and
we're making it easier

for people with the most junk values.

- How do we counteract that?

- It's very difficult.

It's very, very difficult
because people don't realize

where the indoctrination is coming from

and they don't think
they're indoctrinated.

They don't realize that when
you're constantly seeing

really beautiful airbrushed
women all day every day,

and then you're googling
what they look like naked,

and you're being able
to subscribe to that,

they don't realize that
that is severing away

at your ability to connect to
a woman on your actual level.

Like they'll be men who are,
you know, super overweight,

super old, might be from
a different culture,

but they're googling their dream woman

and thinking they deserve them.

They think simply because
they've seen it, they deserve it.

Same thing with women.

They'll be watching couple content

where a man buys a woman
a bag for Christmas

and for Valentine's Day and decorate.

And they think because they've
seen it, they deserve it.

So we have to really
undo the conditioning,

which is difficult to do.

- It almost just sounds like
people should get offline.

- Yeah, I know, and it's like,

how do we counteract online behavior?

We just simply can't, and I say this

from a privileged position.

I didn't grow up with Tinder
and Instagram and stuff.

I didn't grow up with that.

And so when you are
grown up with Snapchat,

you've grown up with Instagram, like,

so they start at 10, 11 years old.

How do we uncondition that young mind?

So I think I'm speaking from a,

it sounds like a higher horse,

but I've actually just
escaped that part of life.

But if I was 10 years younger,
if I was 21, 22 years old,

there would be no way I
would think any differently

to what the young people are thinking now.

- My wife and I, we met each other

like a month before Tinder came out.

And we joke that we like-

- Really, you just met before?

- Just got in-

- So it would've been 2000 and-

- 12.

- 12, oh, is that when
Tinder came out? 2012?

Yeah, it must have been.

- Or it was like a month
or two before I heard it.

- Oh, wow, you just missed it.

- Yeah, yeah.

- Thank goodness.

- Yeah, thank God, right?
- Thank goodness.

- But it's funny though 'cause like

a conversation I often have
with people who come to me

who are single and
frustrated, you know, it's,

I think everything you're saying is true.

I also think the nature of
the dating apps is that,

you know, you have to
set filters for yourself

and you have to set,
you have to define like

what you're looking for and
what you're not looking for.

And I just think that
most of the things that

if you ask somebody, what are
you looking for in a partner?

The most immediate answers
are probably the wrong ones.

You know, people think,
oh, I want somebody

who's like tall and wealthy and funny.

And like, okay, that stuff's nice,

but ultimately that's not the thing

that determines whether it's gonna be

a good partner for you long term or not.

And I just remember,
like, when I think back

to my own dating life, here
comes Mark's old man moment.

So back in my day, when
you actually went to a bar

and talked to a woman, there
were so many circumstances

in my young life where I
would go to a party or dinner

or something and I would meet a woman.

And my initial interest, like
there was no initial interest.

I didn't think she was that attractive.

I wasn't that into her.

But over the course of the
night of like talking to her,

seeing her personality,
seeing her sense of humor,

there was a chemistry there that ended up

being like very sexy.

And actually a lot of those women was like

some of the best relationships
that I had, right?

So it's like you said,
you get this, online,

you get this idealized version
of what a partner should be

that is impossible for
anybody to live up to,

whereas it's almost
better to like not know

what your ideal partner is.

And just kind of like use
that curiosity to go find out.

- But the thing is, you
went in with the mentality

of humanizing women, like wanting to know

what they were like and that's the key.

- Horrible mistake.

(everyone laughs)

- So with that-

- I still haven't recovered.

- With that mentality, you can either

create connection or not.

But with the dehumanized version of dating

that we've created through
online dating apps and Instagram

and pornography, by
dehumanizing both men and women,

we go into relationships
looking what we can

access from them rather than
what we can contribute to them.

And as a result, we've got
endless people almost dating

with a psychopathic kind
of mentality of just,

what can I get rather
than what can I give?

So you'll have men like, I
can get sex from this girl,

I can get this, I can get that.

But they're not looking
at, can I be responsible?

Can I look after, can I
father children, can I do?

So we're forgetting
responsibilities and just looking at

the hedonistic view of
creating connection.

- What say you, single man?

- Well, so I haven't used
dating apps since 2018.

I'm off them.

Yeah, I'm barely on
social media anymore too.

Do you think though too that, dating apps,

not only, somebody could come
in with the right motivations

and they have, you know, solid
values and intrinsic values

like you talk about, but the dating apps

actually prime them more
towards the extrinsic values.

So, you know, just by
the nature of using them,

you're actually pushed in that direction.

- Absolutely, it's catering to that need.

It's kind of making it so
zoomed in on extrinsic values.

You don't know them, you
can only judge by looks.

So when you are beautiful,
you'll be overwhelmed

by the dating apps and
as a result, you start

to dehumanize men and you think,

"Oh, I'm so sick of
responding to these guys."

And when you're a successful
man at it, you dehumanize it

and just use it as sex,
sex, sex, sex, sex.

So what ends up happening is the people

who have the most access
become the most jaded by them.

Yeah, either become too sexual as a man,

or you can become too
fed up of men as a woman.

And the ones that actually have

the best and purest intentions,

they can't even utilize
it for the right reason.

So it gets difficult
for them, for the people

who are actually going in
with the right intentions

'cause they learn very
quickly in order to stand out

and even get a date, you have to cater

to the wrong intentions.

If you're a woman that
wants to actually get

a marriage from it, but you're realizing

you're getting no matches,
she'll end up starting

to show more skin and
therefore attract men

who are looking for her looks.

If you're a man who can't
get any matches, he learns,

let me just post my watch,
or let me just show my car

and then I'll get more matches.

So by design, we end up pushing them

towards intrinsic values.

- You know what is like a
billion-dollar business idea?

Somebody should create a dating app.

Maybe somebody's already tried this.

Somebody should create, you know like

that Netflix show "Love is Blind"?

- Yeah.

- Somebody should create the
dating app version of that

where it's like, it's
personality test-based.

So you get questionnaires
about your values

and your personality and
the things you enjoy doing,

and then you match or
unmatch people based on that.

And then it reveals like
what they look like,

what they do for work,
all that stuff later.

- That would be a cool concept.

But Drew, if you're not on dating apps,

how do you meet people?

- Through friends mostly, yeah.

- 'Cause people always ask
me how they meet people.

Do you know what to say to that?

Like, when people ask you where to meet,

what do you usually say?

- I mean, over the last several years,

people that I've dated,
I've met through friends.

It's a lot slower pace obviously too.

I usually get to know them a little bit.

We'll hang out a few times
and it's like Mark was saying,

you come to find things
attractive about them

that you don't immediately see

or they become attractive over time.

So it's usually through
friends and just yeah,

just putting yourself out there

saying yes to more things for sure, yeah.

- Drew has become very
passionate about yoga,

which is straight man
code for getting a date.

- Well, you've gotta put yourself
in the right environments.

I guess it's worth a try.

Like you gotta put yourself
in the right environments.

But it is very difficult.

I don't know where single
people meet each other sadly.

Outside of apps, I don't know.

'Cause I talk about how bad apps are,

they sometimes can be used as a way

to numb heartbreak as well.

So people don't even
experience heartbreak anymore.

They just jump on an
app, distract themselves.

So we're devoiding
ourselves of human emotions

and therefore devoiding ourselves of

how intimate a relationship should be.

But at the same time, I
don't offer a solution.

So this is where I feel bad,
I don't have a solution.

What's the alternative?

I wish I knew, but I just
unfortunately don't really know.

- I heard you speak about
male-female relationships,

or I'm sorry, friendships, yeah.

And that to me, I've always made

friends easily with other women.

And so I think, you know, having that

and then I'll meet some of their friends

or something like that.

And that's a good, just
a good way to do that.

- Yeah. I've understood the advice of

not having female friends
and not having male friends.

- Do people actually recommend that?

- Yeah. And I, I have so many
of my clients will come to me

and say, "My dating coach says

I should never have female friends."

- Fire him.

- Fire them.

What childish advice is that?

- Some of my closest
friends are women actually.

- Yeah, my coaches friends
have always been male.

And one of the reasons I
have this perspective online

where people are a bit
confused why it's so masculine

is because I've always had male friends.

And the amazing part of male
friends is you finally get to,

you don't sexualize everybody
of the opposite gender.

People without opposite gender friends,

they sexualize everybody.

Everybody of a different
gender, they sexualize.

When you make friends
with the opposite gender,

you're less easily impressed by them

because you know how the
opposite gender works

and you're not easily swayed by

what they say and do
for you but you're also

less excited by the opposite gender.

You actually, it takes more than just them

being a man or them being a woman

for them to gauge your interest.

So I think you really deprive yourself of

a lot of stability when you don't have

the opposite gender friends.

- Absolutely.

I think that's a big reason
why men and women struggle

to make friends with the
opposite gender is that

they don't know how to
stop sexualizing them

or seeing them as some form of other.

But the crazy thing is,
is that if you spend time,

as a man, if you spend time
with a lot of female friends,

you get really good at communicating

and empathizing with
women, which makes you

a much better partner
when you start dating.

- And the other thing it does is

it helps remove women off their pedestals.

So many men I was friends
with when I was younger

who may have had a little crush,

after getting to know me in five minutes,

they could never in a million years, yeah.

They're like, oh, you know, they realize

how quickly attractive, unattractive,

or how quickly we're all the same.

Women are just simply the same.

You talk to them the
same way you would talk

to a non-attractive partner
and it just releases

that anxiety you have with
talking to the opposite gender.

- Yeah.

Yeah, they're human too.

- Yeah.

They're flawed as well and it's just-

- Yeah, everybody shit stinks.

What is the, I mean, other than that,

what else do you think most
men's dating advice gets wrong?

- The first with the lack of friendships,

but the other thing that they
do is they really place a lot

of their self-esteem on the
attractiveness of their partner.

And they derive a lot of their ego from

how attractive their partner is.

And they feel really low self-esteem

when they don't get an attractive partner.

And they make their type an appearance.

So they'll say, "My type
is blonde, blue eyes,"

or, "My type is brunette and curvy."

But my advice is always
make your type of treatment.

How do you get treated by that person?

If every time your type
is blonde, blue eyes,

but she's treating you badly,

she should no longer be your type.

Or if your type is this particular man

and he's not treating you well,

he should no longer be your type,

your type shouldn't just be a decision.

It should be malleable
based on the feedback

you're getting from that type.

So I always try and
say, make your type the,

how much do they soothe your anxieties,

how loved they make you
feel, how connected they,

how do they treat you,
how do you need feeling?

That should become your type.

- You know what's ironic about that?

I used to run into guys
like that all the time.

So full disclosure for listeners,

I started my career as a dating coach.

- Yes, and also, I'm sorry to interrupt,

but Mark's book and "Models"
is absolutely fantastic.

I came across it recently,
I was just telling him

before the show, it is still
so relevant to men today.

And it was written in 2011.

Please go buy that book.

It's fantastic.

As a man, skip this
podcast, go buy that book.

- Your check will be in the mail.

So I started my career coaching men

and I used to run into that all the time.

And I remember the irony with that

is that the men who obsess
over getting the hot girl

or the hottest girl, it's
only to impress other men.

Like they're actually
being driven by a desire

to connect with other men
more than they're being driven

by a desire to connect with women.

And I used to try to tell this to guys,

like, I explain this to
them and I don't know,

it would make their heads explode.

Like, I remember I used
to ask guys, I'm like,

what would you rather?

Behind door number one
is a 10 out of a 10,

but she's a total pain in the ass.

Selfish, doesn't treat you well.

Behind door number two is like

a six or seven out of
10, but she's amazing.

You have so much fun with her.

You're so happy with her.

You like her family, you have great sex.

Which door would you pick?

Now all the sane men
would say door number two.

But occasionally you get a guy

who would say door number one.

And I remember like, I would just stop

the entire session right there.

I'm like, what are you thinking?

Like what is this about really?

'Cause it's not about women clearly.

- It's not about women.

It's about their
relationship with vaginas.

- Yeah.

- And one thing that's
made me a little bit jaded

about working, when I first came out,

I was known as very
misogynistic and very pro men.

And I've no problem with that.

I'm a very, I love men.

I have a very good partner.

I have a great relationship
with my father.

I have a great relationship with men.

But then as I've started
working with more and more men,

as particularly as they get
more and more successful,

they reduce women down to vaginas

because they don't have
the time to become intimate

and connected to their partner

as they get busier and
get more successful,

they reduce them down to sex

and they will risk a very stable,

connected relationship
with their wife and kids,

which might get monotonous, boring.

It happens, it happens in relationship.

They'll risk that for
somebody who has nothing else

going for them but is able
to please them sexually.

Are the normal men going for connection

because they haven't got,
aren't spoiled for choice,

but when men are given all
the money in the world,

do they become more
crude in their selection?

- I don't know.

I mean, the short answer is I don't know.

But you know, I think the relationship

between wealth and
promiscuity is pretty obvious,

which is that the
wealthier you are as man,

the more opportunities you're gonna have.

And the easier it is to cover your tracks.

- Yeah, yeah.

- Like you can afford to
go get that hotel room

for a night or whatever.

- And a personal assistant
who will send the emails

to everybody, yeah, yeah,
know what she's doing.

- So that makes sense.

Like one of the things
that, I had Morgan Housel

on the podcast months ago and he wrote

"The Psychology of Money"
and one of the things

that he said, he said,
"Money doesn't change people,

it amplifies what's already there."

Right, so there's probably a lot of men

who don't have the self-control

or the correct prioritization to be

in a committed relationship,
be faithful, be loyal,

but they also don't have the means

to fuck up their marriage.

And so that almost, like, it
puts guardrails around them,

but then when you get a lot of money,

it removes the guardrails.

So if you are that sort of
man, then it's fair game.

This episode is brought
to you by Timeline,

wizards of life science
and global champions

of longevity research.

When I heard about Timeline's
secret sauce, Mitopure,

and how it could help with muscle recovery

and vitality, I thought,
sure, fuck it, why not?

And guess what?

It's actually been, it's been
great for my health journey.

Mitopure is like a Swiss army knife

of supplements delivering a
precise shot of Urolithin A

to supercharge your mitochondria.

I don't know what that
last sentence means,

but it sounds really fancy and important.

This boosts your cellular energy

and is supposed to add
strength and endurance

like you're prepping for
the zero fuck Olympics.

Think of Mitopure as like a tiny Pac-Man

gobbling up all the worn out mitochondria

that leave you feeling
exhausted and cranky, which,

if you're like me, you're just
always exhausted and cranky.

Also, if you're a fan of morning routines,

so then their berry powder is
pretty fucking bomb as well.

Timeline has given you an exclusive

10% off your first order.

So just hop over to timeline.com/idgaf,

that is timeline.com/idgaf.

- What created the desire,
from your perspective,

to not chase more like
just very shallow qualities

and actually want to get to know women,

actually wanna connect with them

coming from a pickup artist background?

- So I was a little bit
weird in that it took,

and it took me a while
to admit this to myself

because I wanted to be like all bro-y man,

you know, a man's man, whatever.

The sex itself was never
that interesting or exciting.

It was almost the game.

It was like the connection
and the excitement

and the flirtation and the
escalation of everything.

- Chemistry part of things.

- That was the most fun.

Like I actually, it took
me a while to realize this,

but I actually enjoyed,
I would have a night

where I would have this like
amazing kind of romantic,

intimate experience and
not have sex with a woman

then just like find a
drunk girl at the bar

and take her home and bang her

and forget about her the next day.

Like the latter was just
not very satisfying at all.

And eventually I admitted that
to myself and realized that

my issues are actually much
deeper than I thought they were.

And that I just kind of
have this weird craving

or constant desire for intimacy that was,

I wasn't finding a way to fulfill that

in another way, in a healthy way.

And it was, I was very, I had
a lot of commitment issues.

And so I think it was
a compensation of like,

well, I'm terrified of commitment,

but if I can just like, have
all these like romantic flings

and like one week, you know, tris

and it can like overcome that I guess.

- Okay, so that was a mentality,

but do you think that's most
men confusing their desire

for sex when really it's
a desire for intimacy?

- No, my experience is
that I was the exception.

Most men it was-

- They're obsessed with it, right?

- Yeah, either like some
sort of sexual fixation

or in most cases it was a status thing.

And I think it was a
status thing to come back

to your point of like, they
were the nerd growing up,

they had no opportunities,
they were looked down on.

Now they're 25, 30, 35,
they're really successful,

but like they've still got that-

- They're stuck at 16.

- Yeah, they're stuck at 16.

They still have something to prove.

They've still got a chip on their shoulder

and they're like, "You
know, if I sleep with

a bunch of hot girls, then all the guys

at work will like respect me.

Or you know, then I'll
be like the cool guy

that everybody wants to hang out with."

- And they literally get stuck at 16.

I meet men that are 45, 50 years old

and they're still sexualizing
19, 20-year-old girls.

And I can't wrap my head around it.

But online, they give the advice that

that's the way men are.

But I feel like you haven't
humanized enough women

at that age for you to, because
when you meet a 19-year-old,

you should realize she's a child.

You should realize that my desire for her

is me being stuck at 16.

As an adult male, I should recognize that

she's not an adult enough for me

and I shouldn't be sexualizing her.

But they've pushed past that.

And I don't know if
that's pornography-induced

or if it's online information,

but they somehow have
pushed past their disgust

and turned that into
desire for girls of any age

or any background and even
her financial background.

They will exploit that
just for their own gains.

And I don't how that's going to pan out.

- So another epiphany I had
at some point in my adult life

was a realization that
there is a difference

between beauty and sexual attractiveness.

That you can have an extremely
physically beautiful woman

who is not sexually attractive

and you can have a woman
who's not extremely beautiful,

who is very sexually attractive.

Like those two things, I think
most men just couple them

in their brains and they don't
critically think about that.

And so they'll see a hot 19-year-old

and their just immediate
assumption is like,

"She's hot, I wanna fuck her."

And they haven't thought through
that process anymore yet.

And to the point where they
would have the emotional,

I mean it is essentially
emotional maturity

that we're talking about
of like realizing that,

you know, sexualization is like almost

the most primitive form of-

- Of evaluating a product.

- Evaluating a person or seeing somebody.

And when you open yourself up to kind of

these more emotional levels
and the different dynamics

that play out between two people,

that you can actually lose attractiveness.

I remember when I was
like, 'cause I worked

with a lot of those guys, you know?

45-year-olds who wanted
to date 20-year-olds.

I never really got it, but
I remember when I was like

28 or 29, I went on a
date with a 19-year-old

and I couldn't get through the date.

I was like, this is, I'm with a child.

Like she is literally a child.

And like, there's nothing
for us to talk about.

There's nothing interesting
going on in her life.

Like, why am I here?

- And I feel that even when
I have therapy clients,

so when I have like an a
21-year-old might come to me

and I almost feel guilty because I'm like,

I'm getting impatient
with this conversation

and I'm treating you like a child

when really you're coming to me for help.

But because the inability to kind of

complete their sentences
or know their thoughts,

it's totally what should
be happening at their age.

But I'm coming at it
as a lens, as an adult.

So I can't imagine being
able to sexualize somebody

that you know is still so early

in their development of intelligence.

And I'll get men who will come to me

and say, "Oh, my ex-wife was a narcissist.

She was so terrible.

I want you to kind of
work with my daughter.

I don't want her to grow up like her mom.

Please work with my daughter."

And I'll work with their daughter

and she'll be like a 16-year-old.

And she says, "My dad is
currently dating a 21-year-old

and he's 56, and that's
making me uncomfortable."

So they somehow have not
taken any accountability

for the selection process.

They still have that poor
selection and then wonder why

the women that they're selecting
are becoming narcissistic.

It's because they can see that
your desire only one trait

of them, and you don't
genuinely care about them.

You only care about what
they add to your status.

So as a woman, she should exploit you

because you're exploiting her.

So she should financially exploit you,

but they want her to be dedicated to him

while he is utilizing her
for his own status and gain.

So I just think if you're a 19-year-old

using and abusing a
44-year-old, good for you

because he's doing the same to you.

But yeah, but he thinks
he's sincere and genuine.

- It's funny, like, so,
you know, in the past

when this topic has come up,
I've gotten a lot of flack

from other men who are like,
you know, I don't know.

- They think we're jealous and they-

- Yeah, they're like, "Oh,
Mark's such a beta, you know,

like he doesn't get it."

But it's funny because I
used to think that way.

- Right.

- And then I did enough
work on myself emotionally

and mentally to when I
stop thinking that way.

And what these guys
don't understand is that

when you stop thinking that way,

it frees you to such an extent.

Like it is a prison to see 50%
of the population as vaginas.

It's a fucking prison.

- Prison.

- You are imprisoned by your dick.

And you are captured and like being forced

into relationships that
are not making you happy

over and over and over again.

And there's, for some reason,
some men just don't see that.

They're like so captured.

They have like Stockholm
syndrome to their cock.

Like they're just like, "No,
this is what dick says to do.

Just so dick makes me happy."

And like it doesn't make you happy.

- And I really realized it when I realized

that there's a thing
called like glory holes

where people go into
and they go into places.

- Did you just find out about it?

- Yeah, wait a second.

- I discovered this two weeks ago

because there was a comedian
talking about it on TikTok.

- Oh, bless you, child.
- And I thought he was joking.

I genuinely thought he was joking.

I thought it was part of a skit.

- You haven't met enough men.

- Oh my god.

- And then somebody told
me, no, it's a real thing.

You put your penis in
a hole and anyone can,

and I just thought imagine being that much

of a slave to your impulses,
that much of a slave

that you are willing to risk it all.

That could be a man, woman,
child, anyone behind the screen,

but you're that much of
a slave to your impulses.

And I just thought, oh my goodness,

I know I'm really late to the party,

but that's a normal thing?

- The glory hole party.

- Is that a normal thing?

I had no idea that was a thing.

- It is a thing.

It is a thing.

I do think part of the
excitement around the glory hole

is that you don't know
what's on the other side.

- Oh, I can't think of it.

Is that, oh, okay, so
I'm seeing it in the,

what I'm describing is actually

what they actually like about it.

- Yes.

- Oh, okay, got it.

Goodness me.

So do you know if you really
get into a man's mind,

is it really that
primitive when it comes to

how they see women on a fundamental level?

- No, no, it's not an
all or nothing thing.

I think it's, I mean, look,
it's when you get into

sexual arousal, like, we're animals.

And so there's some like
very base primitive stuff

that happens post sexual arousal.

I think, but just because
something can potentially happen

post sexual arousal doesn't mean that

that's what you always think of.

Like this is something that's actually,

if you ever look into like, well,

you don't know what glory holes are.

So if you ever decide to get into BDSM,

what you'll discover is that they,

but they talk about this
a lot that, you know,

just because you are
into something during sex

doesn't mean that you are
that way outside of sex.

So like, if you're a masochist

and you like to be dominated during sex,

that doesn't give the person permission

to dominate you outside of sex.

- Like they're two different realms.

- So separate the realms.

- Because, and it really is.

Like people get into things,
you know, it activates like

kind of the most animalistic
part of your brain.

And so there's stuff
down there that kicks in.

And I imagine most men relate to this,

that afterwards you're like, "Oh my god,

I can't believe I did that."

- Yeah.

- Drew, tell us more.

- Okay, actually, I'd like to get off

glory holes and BDSM real quick.

- Please do.

- Let's go back to your point.

- Yeah, what were we talking about?

- So like the oversexualizing.

- Yeah, the oversexualizing,
that's what important.

And I would imagine the use of pornography

and the availability would just activate

that side of the brain so much.

- Yes.

- 100%, 100%.

- And the dating apps too, social media,

it all feeds into that.

Pornography is a big one too.

I'm a weirdo.

I don't know, I don't use dating apps.

I'm pretty much off social media.

I don't use porn.

- Yeah.

Amazing, you don't use porn?

- No, no, I don't.

- [Sadia] I'm so happy for you.

- Drew is-

- He's a gem.

- What I've found though
through from that-

- The most eligible bachelor in podcast.

- Yeah, no.

- I'm convinced at this point that Mark

started this podcast just
to give me a girlfriend.

- Well, you should.

Like, you deserve a good woman.

You deserve a good woman.

- Submit your applications.

- I'm gonna look.

- What I've noticed from that though,

and I don't know, it's kind
of all three of those things.

Dating apps, you know, porn, social media.

I now have gotten, that little
voice you were talking about

that like, men have this, oh, I want to be

a higher status man in the
eyes of other men even too.

I just don't give a shit anymore really.

Maybe that's part of, part of that's

probably getting older as well.

But I've just noticed that
I have a far greater need

for connection with somebody now

before I'm even remotely
attracted to them.

So yeah, like, younger
women just, it's not,

- And I get a lot of hate because-

people are always like,
"Oh, you're just jealous."

I'm really not jealous.

I'm very happy in my relationship.

And if my husband did
leave me for a 19-year-old,

it wouldn't make me
jealous of the 19-year-old.

It'd make me look at
him in a different way.

- And be like, what the hell, dude?

- Yeah, what's going on in your life that

this is what you've decided to do?

So it's nothing in that sense.

It's just more of a
sense of what men think

when they walk into a room with a woman

that's 20 years younger and smoking hot

while they're not, they think
everyone's thinking, wow.

But what we're really thinking
is how are you stupid enough

to not realize why she's here?

We're not thinking, wow, you're so cool.

We're thinking, wow, you're really rich.

Other women might look at you thinking,

okay, I can also use and abuse him.

And other men are looking at you like, oh,

you're probably really enjoying
it, but how much is she?

And they're probably
thinking they have a chance.

So you devalue your status, if anything,

rather than enhance it.

But they've got the, because
the outward statements

would be like, wow, she's
super hot, they're looking for

those outward statements rather than

internal dialogue that
people are having about them.

- Well, and you raise
an interesting point,

which is the perception
of other men, right?

Because a lot of these men who say like,

"No, you don't get it, you're
just jealous," or whatever,

part of that is that all the
men that they hang out with

think the same way as them.

- That still is, yeah.

- They don't realize that the majority

of the male population thinks
that's immature and stupid.

Why would you ever do that?

But the reason they're not exposed to us

is because it's like,
and this has happened

many times where I have met a guy who is

very impressive professionally,
seems very intelligent,

has a lot of interesting things to say.

And he's like bringing escorts around

or dating a girl who's like
less than half his age.

And I lose all respect for him.

- I mean, automatically.

- 'Cause it says so
much about his character

and his self-control and his composure

and what he values in life.

And it just makes me realize, I'm like,

okay, this is not a serious person.

- And also their emotional intelligence.

I can't imagine a man
feeling, I don't know how

he has to block out that part of his brain

where he doesn't care if she enjoys it,

if she wants it, if she's lubricated,

none of that, none of that matters

as long as he's achieved his goal.

Wouldn't part of the enjoyment

of the sexual intercourse be the fact

that she wants you and
she's so aroused by you?

But having to buy her
arousal just seems that

you are almost compensating her

for this bad experience
she's about to have.

So it's indicative of how poor you think

your performance is.

That's how as a woman sees it.

We see you must be terrible at this

and that's why you have
to compensate women

for their time and for being with you.

- But I think part of that is

it comes back to the power thing.

- Power.

- Because it's what arouses
them is kind of the fact that

it doesn't matter if she's into it or not.

- Oh wow, men are disgust, I'm sorry.

You guys are so weird.

- We're turning Sadia into-

- You're so weird.

- She's like, "I don't want
to coach these guys anymore."

- Oh, I think I've just
been so naive a little bit

with this area of life
'cause my advice initially

was very, I'm a very traditional woman

and I come from a Muslim background.

So my advice was always
like, what's the problem?

You can have a great guy, you
know, you'd be loyal to him

and faithful and just
be good to his family.

Like, what's the problem?

It's easy to get a man.

As I've been working
with more and more men,

I realize that the underlying trait is

none of that matters
until you sleep with them

in the way that they like.

And that's what I realize and that's why-

- Sometimes.

- Sometimes, yeah.

Or he has a low sex drive, in
which case then you're great.

Yeah, then you've got
nothing to worry about.

But if he has a high sex
drive and you're doing

all of those things without access to you,

it doesn't actually, yeah,

it doesn't actually matter as much.

- It also depends on the man.

It also depends on his maturity level

and his, you know, it's just-

- Yeah, so there's a lot of components.

- I have a high sex
drive when I was younger.

I didn't really know how to manage that

and I think I let it manage me.

- Right.

- And as I got older, I
learned how to manage it.

And, you know, now I'm married

and it's, I just, I manage it.

Like, it's not a problem anymore.

Like at a certain point as a man,

I think most men have
to make this decision

of just like you can't
keep prioritizing it.

Like you're just not gonna build a good,

stable, interesting life for yourself.

- It just can't be a priority forever.

- If you're following your
dick around everywhere.

Like, it just, it's not a
sustainable life strategy.

So at some point you
just have to decide like,

you know what, sex just needs to

matter less than it used to.

- Exactly.

- And that's fine.

- There's a lot of
compartmentalization too that men do.

Like you've kind of already
mentioned that as well.

And I think that's how they can separate

a lot of those areas.

And for whatever reason, I'm not sure

how that works out
developmentally or whatever.

Or, you know, if something
has happened to them

or they've just, how they
were raised, I don't know.

But I think men are just really good at

compartmentalizing this
part of their lives.

- [Sadia] Yeah, that's true.

That's very true.

- And a lot of the inability to empathize,

to connect emotionally,
to humanize with women

is directly proportional to

the objectification of themselves.

Like, this is something
I used to write about

and like men, like, I used
to try to explain to men.

I was like, objectifying women is bad.

But it's not just bad because
it's bad for the women.

It's bad for you.

When you see women as status objects,

you aren't just hurting them.

You're hurting yourself
because you are basing

your entire emotional life
around status objects,

around collecting
trophies and achievements.

- That's a very great point.

- To impress your guy friends who honestly

don't really give a shit because

they're emotionally stunted as well.

So it's just a bad game
to be playing, period.

- Yeah, they're objectifying themselves

usually financially as well.

That they really are just
a financial component.

So they're volunteering
for that objectification.

Both parties are in those circumstances.

- What is the biggest piece
of women's dating advice

that is wrong in your opinion?

- But in terms of the
worst piece of advice

that women are getting is
the narcissistic movement.

The movement about how every
person you've disagreed with

ever in your life is a narcissist.

Whether that's your mom,
your dad, or your ex-partner.

Everybody's a narcissist
and they use these buzzwords

like gaslighting, bread
crumbing, all of this stuff.

So it is the worst piece of
advice women have got to.

And the reason I say that
is nine times out of 10

when somebody's come to me and said

so-and-so's a narcissist, they
are a narcissist themselves.

They have a narcissistic desire

to be a victim in every situation,

they have a narcissistic desire
to avoid any accountability,

and they have a narcissistic desire

for excessive sympathy from
the people around them.

And so the people who
claim that they're victims

of narcissists are usually
the narcissists themselves.

They're just in reverse.

They like to be a victim.

Real people who've been
abused by narcissists

will come to me and say,
"How do I get better?

Because my husband says I'm too fat.

My husband," they're actually trying

to please the narcissists.

They're so brainwashed by the narcissist

that they think they have done

nothing right in this relationship.

They're awful and they need to improve.

But if you are in the end where you're

posting memes about a narcissist,

you haven't been through
narcissistic abuse.

You've just been in a bad relationship,

which both of you have contributed
to equally I would say.

So I think that movement has
been really damaging for women.

Yeah.

- I could see that.

- [Sadia] Yeah.

- It's funny, there's a quote that I love

from David Foster Wallace.

He says that, "Evil people
don't believe that they're evil,

they believe everyone else is evil."

I think you could replace
evil with narcissists.

Like narcissists don't
believe they're narcissists,

they believe everyone
else is a narcissist.

- Exactly, exactly that.

And it just sets them
up for so much failure.

There's so much lack of accountability.

There's so much digging into like trying

to diagnose this person rather than,

how did I get to this state?

How did I choose this person?

Why have I chosen this person?

And how do I improve and make
sure I don't do it again?

Instead, they just want
to speak to a therapist

that will tell them, "You are a victim.

You have totally chosen badly.

You did nothing wrong.

How can I cushion you to feel better?

And that will be $1,000, please."

That's what they wanna hear, yeah.

- What would you say is the worst piece

of advice that women are getting?

- That women are getting?

- Yeah.

- I don't know.

I'm kind of out of this
world at the moment,

but like, I don't keep up
with the dating advice world

as much as I used to, but
I generally, as a rule,

I feel like the dating advice for women

is over reliant on
protecting their feelings.

And this kind of relates
to the narcissism thing.

Like they shouldn't tolerate
anything that upsets them.

They shouldn't tolerate, you
know, they deserve to feel good

and happy and cherished
and feel like a queen

and all this stuff all the time.

That's unrealistic.

That's not really looking for a partner,

that's looking for like a parent

that's gonna pamper them and baby them.

And so I find a lot of that
vein of female dating advice.

I mean, it's tricky
because I think women have

a tendency to, women have a
little bit more of a tendency

to try to fix a broken
relationship like for too long.

They tend to stay in bad relationships

for too long I think more than men do.

So I understand like trying to coach women

to have better standards for themselves

and have higher expectations for those.

I think that overall is a good thing,

but I just think maybe
the way it's communicated

by being over, like it should be,

the language should revolve
around things like respect

and trust and shared
values and boundaries.

It shouldn't be about, well,

you deserve to feel like a princess.

And you should be treated like a princess.

- Yeah, it should be mutual
trust and mutual skills

rather than just entitlement.

- And by the way, sometimes
mutual trust and mutual like,

shared values, like
sometimes, it's uncomfortable.

You know, it's-

- 'Cause I got hate for
saying that like men,

because women in this dating world,

liking another woman's picture

is a real big like, issue for women,

which I completely understand.

As a woman myself, I
know what it feels like.

So liking pictures is a real problem.

But then they see nothing wrong

in posting provocative pictures.

And they think the male,
they don't see that

as a female equivalent.

It's the female equivalent.

If a man's liking a
bunch of bikini pictures

and you're posting, it's the
male and female equivalent,

but they see it as, no,
I can do whatever I want,

but don't do that 'cause
that hurts my feelings.

And so they're almost
breeding the narcissism

in the women by
overprotecting their feelings

and how they feel, and if
they feel it, it must be true.

And that's the mentality
that's put in them.

Drew, as somebody who's dating and stuff,

is it difficult with women at the moment?

What do you notice is some of the advice

that has encapsulated their brains?

- I don't know if it's difficult.

Again, I've slowed way down,
which has helped a lot.

I think there are a lot of

just unrealistic expectations
right now for sure.

And throw on top of that,
like the paradox of choice

that we have at the moment.

That's what's making it difficult as well.

And but I think you're right.

It's just they talk about the
battle of the sexes, right?

We've set up a war that just can't be won.

We have this tit for tat
going on that we're explaining

and this is a weird moment we're in

where it's all scaled with
technology and it's, yeah.

We just, it's a race to the bottom.

- You just said kind of the
curse of high expectations.

When I think about all of my friends,

male and female who are still
single and don't wanna be,

almost across the board,
unanimously, almost.

There are a couple exceptions,
but almost all of them,

it's a curse of high expectations.

Like, they just have this checklist

that is completely
unreasonable in their brain.

- And especially when they can't meet

their own expectations.

They're looking for somebody above them

in almost every trait, and
then they think they're single.

Because I always say to them,
when somebody comes to me,

and they're perpetually single.

It's either that they don't
love themselves enough

and they keep going to the wrong people

and just settling for too little

and then eventually being
too abused and have to leave,

or more often than not, they
have this excessive self-love

where they think they deserve

so much better than what they offer.

Men and women, both of
them deserve so much better

than what they offer, but simply because

they've seen other people access it

or they've seen it online.

So they're waiting for
their moment to access this,

but they're not realizing

if they're actually worthy of that.

So if you have found yourself
single for too long, make sure

that you don't have a delusion
of what your value is.

- I think some of it too
is that a lot of useful

and traditional advice
that exists in, say,

productivity or personal
development has bled over

into relationships and it doesn't apply.

Like, I think if you look at people,

especially the highly ambitious people,

people who start
businesses, like, you know,

there's a lot of advice of, you know,

that essentially boils
down to the harder you try,

the better it's gonna get.

- And believe in yourself
kind of mentality.

- Whereas in relationship,
that's not true, you know?

Or like have, you know,
have higher expectations

'cause you'll perform better.

Like shoot for the moon,
all this stuff, like,

in relationships, it doesn't
translate one to one.

You know, I had a good
friend of mine who is

in his early 40s, and
he's a really good guy

and he like genuinely wants to

settle down and meet his wife.

I was talking to him, this
was like a year or two ago,

and he was just, he was really frustrated

and I was like, "Okay, list out,

like what are all of the non-negotiables

that you need to have in a partner?"

And he started listing out
all these things, you know,

she needs to be smart,
she needs to be beautiful,

she needs to love to travel, she needs to,

and it just went on and on and on.

And like, he ended up
with like a list of like

eight or nine pretty
difficult things to find.

And I looked at him, I'm like,

"Okay, now cross out half of these."

And he couldn't do it.

And I was like, that's why you're single.

- Yeah.

- That's why you're single.

- And it's not that we're
saying you need to settle.

We're just saying, just be realistic.

'cause that's all it is.

They see realism as a form of settling

when it's simply not the case.

It's just be realistic.

And as long as the
treatment part of things

is never mentioned in the
checklist, it's never that

I want somebody who checks
in quite a lot when I'm away

or somebody who is able
to label the relationship

quite early, somebody
who communicates well,

it's always just more aesthetic.

- It's traits, it's, yeah.

The settling thing is a
really interesting topic

because I feel like that's become

a dirty word in our generation.

And I understand that
again, maybe it kind of

comes from the productivity
mindset of like,

you don't wanna settle for
what's like not optimal.

Like you've got this idea of like

what the perfect person would be

and you don't want to stop
short of achieving that goal.

- Yeah.

- Because in other areas of your life,

that's a bad thing to do.

But in relationships, it actually works

the other way around because
what you realize is that

it's actually in the acceptance
of your partner's flaws

that you find most of the intimacy,

that you unlock the
closeness that it's seeing

the shortcomings and loving them anyway.

Like even just saying that,

it like probably sounds like a bad thing.

- But it's not truly love if you haven't

had to compromise on anything.

- [Mark] Exactly.

- Yeah, if you've got perfection
and it's not truly love.

Love is when you can fight
through the imperfections

and kind of go against what
you thought you wouldn't accept

in order to be with this person

because this person's so valuable.

- Yeah.

- Yeah, because I'll sometimes have women

in their late 30s and they'll say,

"I don't wanna date a man with kids."

And I just say, "Look, realistically,

if you wanna be a mother
and stuff, realistically,

you're not gonna find someone
with no kids whatsoever,

and if you do find that, it puts

a lot of pressure on your body.

What if you can't have it?

And then you're doing
rounds of IVF and stuff.

If they already have children,

your mind could be like, 'Perfect,

at least if I'm having any problems,

I don't deprive them of being a father,

but I also get a child in the process.'

And then whatever happens, happens."

It's not settling, it's adapting,

but it's the refusal to
adapt, which they see

as settling that gets them right.

- And it comes back to the narcissism.

- Narcissism.

- It's like, why should
I give anything up?

Why should I change myself?

You know, they should change for me.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

What do you see is the relationship

between self-esteem and relationships?

- So without self-esteem,
not only will you not be able

to receive love, but you
don't give it correctly.

The thing is like people
with low self-esteem

tend not to receive love very well,

we know that, but they also
don't give it very well.

And the reason why they don't give it is

their love is coming from
an empty hole in them.

So they'll give love to the
person that can fill that hole.

If they are somebody who's
not financially stable,

they'll love the person who
financially stabilizes them.

If they're not somebody who's attractive,

they'll love the person that
makes them feel attractive.

If they're somebody who's not confident

in their sexual skills,
they'll attach to the person

who makes them feel like they are.

They're coming from a place of egoism.

And as a result, when that
person stops feeding that egoism,

their low self-esteem is not enough

to keep them happy so they lash out.

So it's very difficult to form

any kind of long lasting relationship.

And I've learned this the hard way myself

without self-esteem because
you accept the unacceptable

and you seek sometimes the unacceptable

and you can't maintain
relationships because

you don't have the source of
self-love to maintain it, yeah.

- I feel like it's also where
the power struggles kick in.

Because then you start
seeing relationships

in terms of conditions of like,
what are you doing for me?

You know, oh, I'm here because

you are making me feel this way.

But now you stop making me feel this way,

so I'm gonna do this thing to hurt you

so that you do the thing
to make me feel good again.

And you get this tit for tat going

and it just spirals out of control.

- The one thing I'm even
interested in myself,

I always wonder, how do you
know that you've reached

a relationship with high self-esteem?

How do you know that it's
actually high self-esteem?

And I only realize that
even myself when I felt like

I completely love my partner,

but I have a willingness to walk away

if I was very extremely
disrespected or things were wrong.

I think maybe previously I would've

just clung on for dear life or
left very easily regardless.

So there's a willingness to fight,

but there's also a willingness
to leave if need be.

And it's finding that balance.

I think I used to tip over
too much on the willingness

to walk away or tip off on
too much on the willingness

to stay regardless of treatment.

And only when you have that balance

that I feel, you never know,
but I feel more confident.

But I don't know the exact measure of

how you know your self-esteem is right.

- My intuition is going towards,

it's one of those like,
if you have to ask,

then it's probably not there.

You know, I think about
really insecure relationships

that I was in in the past.

There was kind of this constant
questioning of our status.

Are we good?

Is she happy?

Am I happy?

Is she getting what she wants?

Am I getting, like-

- There's a curiosity.

- You're constantly
wondering and stressing over

all these kind of existential questions

within the relationship.

And I just know like within
my wife, there's like peace.

There's just, the questions
don't even come up

because there's no need to ask them.

It's just things are good.

I think that's another aspect that

an optimal relationship is actually

when nothing needs to be optimized.

Like it's just, there's
no questions even arise

because both people are
just comfortable and happy.

- I'm sorry to ask,
but how do we know then

there's a difference
between that there's peace

or there's denial?

Yeah, because sometimes
some men will come to me

and say, "We have a great relationship."

Some men will be like thrown off guard.

They're like, "We had
a great relationship,

our sex life was great,
there was nothing wrong,

and I found out she was having
an affair the whole time."

But what I'm guessing is
there was some element

of denial to keep the peace.

So I would say that the
peace, as you described,

definitely a relationship
that require the peace,

but the peace is not
achieved by you suppressing

what your actual thoughts and desires are.

The peace is achieved
because there's a synchrony

in what you both desire.

- Yeah.

- And is the peace achieved through,

this is bumping up against boundaries,

which, you know, you're both real big on.

- Yeah.

- Like Mark, you wanna get to that point

in your relationship where you
are at that level of peace.

I think you have to get there through

a series of boundaries
and enforcing them, right?

And you've talked before,
Sadia, about boundaries

and that they're kind of the instructions

or teaching people how to love you.

- Yeah.

- Can you talk more about that, I guess?

- Yeah, the thing is, and I've
been guilty of this myself,

people feel like they
have a strength to them

if they can just cut people off instantly

and they're like, you broke
my boundaries, I cut them off.

And they feel so strong about that.

But that's actually a signal of weakness.

The real strength of boundaries
comes with your willingness

to teach people how to truly
love you, not play mind games.

So what I mean by this
is if you're somebody

who doesn't appreciate
your partner leaving you

for weeks on end to go travel, you simply,

it's not that you hold
them by the throat and say,

"You've gotta do this,
you've gotta do that."

It's more just a case of, "I
like us to be more connected.

So this is what I value in a relationship.

If you would, if that's something that

you're compatible with or you
can work towards, perfect.

If not, then I wish you the best,

but it's not necessarily
ideal for our relationship."

But you're working towards
a compromise rather than

just cutting people off immediately.

Boundaries I always say is a bit like

when you're ordering in a restaurant.

If they ask you what are your allergies,

you have to tell them.

You have to tell them
what your allergies are.

And if they don't have
anything that caters to you,

you don't scream at the waitress.

You simply go to another restaurant.

Where people get it
wrong is that they think,

"This is my boundaries.

You have to listen to me.

I don't want you going out,
I don't want you to do this."

But they keep enforcing them,

getting more and more
toxic instead of thinking,

"Well, if this person
doesn't wanna change,

I should just leave.

The end goal is with me, not
with the person changing."

So it's a very tricky
one, but it's one that

if you can just set them early,

you'll filter out the wrong people anyway.

And throughout the
relationship, you'll be in line

with each other's boundaries.

- Yeah.

I'm still thinking about that question

about the guy who thought
everything was great.

- Naive.

Yeah, the denial rather than peace story.

- Yeah, my first
relationship was like that.

I was completely oblivious, but I think-

- But in your mind, was it
peaceful, the relationship?

- So here's the funny thing.

It was not peaceful.

She and I fought all the time.

But in my head, that was normal.

- Right.

- That that was okay.

That that's just what relationships do.

And so it never occurred
to me that, so I think

part of it is just a poor definition

of like what a good relationship is.

So you can be sitting in a pool of shit,

but like if your
understanding of relationships

is that they're all pools of shit,

then you're like, this is fine.

- That's fine, yeah.

- Whereas I also think too that,

you know, some of it comes
down to communication.

I could see there being a case

where it's like maybe he was happy.

Maybe the relationship had been kind of,

she had been catering
to him for a long time.

And so in his head he's
like, "This is great.

Relationship's great,
I'm happy, she's happy."

And either she didn't
communicate that she was unhappy

to him, which then it's
a communication breakdown

or she tried to communicate to
him, but he just shut it down

and wouldn't listen or didn't
respect what she was saying.

What's coming up to me as
I think about this is that

there is a process within
the relationship of,

I guess, constructive
critical conversations.

- Yeah.

Peace is not achieved through suppressing

what you actually need to talk about.

- You earn it through
difficult conversations.

- Yeah, yeah.

- Through uncomfortable conversations.

And I think one thing that my wife and I,

we were always good at it together,

but I think we've gotten
excellent at it over the years,

is having those difficult
conversations and remaining

non-judgmental and not
taking things too personally.

- Did you ever have fiery
fights with this particular,

with your wife or not so much?

Is she just-

- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

- She's got that nature.
- She's Brazilian.

- I was just getting there.

'Cause I have a fiery nature as well.

- Yeah, yeah, I never
wonder what she's feeling.

(everyone laughs)

- So, because then I always
sometimes wonder, am I like,

'cause my partner would
definitely say that

it's not easy being with
somebody who is so opinionated

and so, so I don't
know, like, I don't know

if he would describe me
as a peaceful person,

but he knows how to create
peace in our relationship.

- Well, the funny thing is, is that

you adapt to each other, right?

So when I first started dating my wife,

she was extremely fiery and
emotional and very expressive.

And it was sometimes it was a lot.

Sometimes I was like, oh my god, there's,

I would feel overwhelmed.

But as the years have gone on,

I've just gotten accustomed to it.

And I've learned how to read,
you know, it used to be,

you know, maybe she would seem
very upset about something,

but it turned out that it was actually

a minor thing and she's just Brazilian.

- Yeah, yeah, that's what I was trying

to explain to my part.

- To my white boy brain,
it sounds extremely upset.

But now it's like I've calibrated to her.

And so I can see now if
she's kind of, you know,

yelling about something,
I can actually see

if it's actually a problem
or if she's just temporarily.

- And it usually passes.

It's just for, well,
women, I know I sympathize

'cause I have a similar nature.

It is just a simple vetting process.

Like just venting out
and it will calm down.

Where men sometimes get it wrong is

they overreact to our reaction.

When really you just
gotta let it slide down

and it will come back to normal.

And then you'll see that
she's back to normal again.

- Which this gets back to the value

of just long-term intimacy, commitment.

There's a joy in that.

And I think the same way
people have, you know,

different communication styles,

people have different emotional styles,

people have different
emotional backgrounds.

You just learn each other
over a long period of time.

Like you learn to read each other

and understand what
each other are thinking

and feeling at any given moment.

And I've just discovered
like there's a real joy

and to come back to the word
peace of developing that

with somebody over the course of a decade,

that you can't recreate
that in any other way.

And you know, it's one of those things

that if I could go back and
talk to 20-year-old Mark,

you know, I'd like take
him by the shoulders

and explain that to him.

Like, you know, the novelty and the thrill

that you're seeking in this, like,

large variety of romantic experiences,

actually the biggest thrill
and the most uniqueness

is going deep on one romantic experience.

- And what would you say to men

whose main worry is going deep into one,

is that you might lose
the sexual interest?

- Deprioritize sex.

- Amazing.

- Like, do you just wanna live by the code

of the dick for the rest of your life?

- Thank you.

This is so refreshing.

- There are some things that
are more important in life.

- God, this is so, because
I'm dealing with clients

where they really prioritize that

and they'll leave wives after
wife or woman after woman.

I've got mentors getting
a bit jaded thinking

this is just how men think now,

but you just simply
have to deprioritize it.

- You have to realize that just by the act

of being in this profession,
you are self-selecting.

- Skewed, yeah, very skewed.

- For a certain population.

- And even the people who watch
my content is self-selection

of people who maybe going through it.

So I still have a very warped perception

of the world from it.

- Absolutely.

And to come back to the
maturity point, like I do think

it is, sexuality is very, very tied

to young men's self-esteem.

Like, it just, there's something
about it that young men,

as they kind of discover their sexuality,

it's a huge deal to you.

And it's really this
figuring your sexuality out,

figuring out your dating
opportunities, figuring out

a lot of it's probably tied
to kind of figuring out

where you are in the status hierarchy.

You know, it is a big deal to young men,

but the point is to mature past it

and not be beholden to it
for the rest of your life.

If you are in your 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s

and you're still
obsessing over this stuff-

- Then you're stuck at 16.

- You're stuck back at 16 or 20.

And that's not appropriate.

So I would say I imagine a lot

of your audience is younger men.

Like if you're a 18 or 20-year-old man,

yeah, you probably should
be kind of obsessing

over sex and girls and, you
know, does she like you?

Does she not like you?

Why doesn't she like you?

Like, those are normal things
to obsess about at that age.

But the goal is to move
past it at some point.

- Yeah, yeah.

That's the goal, perfect.

Good to hear that.

There are normal people.

- There is sanity in the world, Sadia.

There is, I promise.

- You must look hard,
you must look hard, yeah.

- I just have a very warped perception

and sometimes I get
really jaded and I say,

and then I have to remind myself,

do you know why I have this perception?

It's because before I was online

and before I started doing
therapy more and more,

the friends I had were always,
because I had male friends,

it was men who are
comfortable around women

and men who are
comfortable rejecting women

and men who had really great
relationships with women.

So I just assumed all
men have that mentality.

And it's only when I got into
this world that I realized

for a lot of men, they are
suffering when it comes to this.

They don't have access to women

and they don't have that
experience of saying no to women.

And they've never experienced
being able to walk into a room

and get the girl you had your eye on.

So then I guess I was
unaware of the impact

that has on their entire psychology.

And that's what I've
learned more and more, yeah.

- I think the same way women are judged

quite a bit by their appearance.

- Yeah.

- I think men are judged quite a bit

by their charisma or lack of charisma.

- [Sadia] Yeah.

- By their ability to at
least have potential partners.

- [Sadia] Yeah.

- And I think that is
ultimately is what, you know,

when you see that
55-year-old man walking in

with a 20-year-old escort,
that's what that is

is that he still has that insecurity,

and he's still trying,
there's some voice in his head

that he's still trying to prove wrong,

still trying to say,
"Mo, I am the cool guy.

I promise, I'm the cool
kid at school, I promise.

Look how hot she is."

And it's really hard,
you know, especially if

you go through a lot of
really negative experiences

when you're young, it's really hard.

- It's really hard, yeah.

So I know it sounds critical,

but I'm actually trying to
understand them a bit more.

And I'm trying to understand
where they're coming from.

So it's good to hear that
they can deprioritize it

if they've had the right
level of love shown to them.

- Yeah, and I will say too, my experience

when I worked in that industry as well,

is that the majority
of men would come to me

wanting a lot of sexual partners.

They would learn some social skills,

maybe dress a little bit better,

develop a little bit of confidence.

They'd get a couple sexual partners,

but within a year, they've settled down

with a girlfriend and that's actually

what they wanted all along.

- They want it completely.

- I would say 75, 80% of
the time that was the case.

It was really only kind
of a loud minority of men

who developed this like fixation.

- I would imagine there
would be porn addicts.

- Today, probably.

- Yeah, in today's world,
they would be the ones

that are addicted to pornography.

- 100%, for sure yes.

- It makes them addicted to novelty

and inability to build
connections, so yeah.

- Yeah, in glory holes.

- I just, not to be personable,

would you ever try something like that?

- Fuck no.

- Thank god.

Oh my god.

Yeah, how scary is that?

- No, no, no, no.

- TO each their own but.

- To each their own, to each their own.

- I am an open-minded
guy, but not that open.

Amazing.

Sadia, Sadia.

- However you like.

- However.

- Miss Khan.

- Miss Khan, ah, I like that.

- It's been a pleasure.

- Thank you so much for having me.

- So great having you out here.

And thank you Drew.

- Yes, thank you.

- For representing the single men.

- Yeah.

- [Mark] The single man.

- I don't know if we got
anywhere with me, but.

- No, you were.

- The applications are open, ladies.

Drew Birnie, the most eligible podcaster.

- Absolutely.

Thank you guys again for having me.

I really appreciate you guys.

- Thank you.

- Thank you.
