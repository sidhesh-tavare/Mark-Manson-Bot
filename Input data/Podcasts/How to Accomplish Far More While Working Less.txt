in a recent survey of 12,000 people

across 15 countries a shocking 75% of

office workers said that they had

experienced burnout in the past year

burnout is defined as chronic workplace

stress or constant feelings of energy

depletion and exhaustion not only has

this become more common in the past

decade but post pandemic it has reached

well epidemic proportions yet this is

despite the fact that more people than

ever have flexibility both both between

and within jobs we are more able to

choose our hours work where we want and

for who we want on what we want than any

other time in history on paper things

should be great for workers yet they're

suffering more than ever so what the

[ __ ] is going on here are people just

whiny and weak or is there something

deeper and more psychological going on

today's episode is all about

productivity burnout and why when given

more freedom and flexibility in our jobs

our minds appear to burn out faster it's

a complicated and nuanced subject and a

must here for anyone who struggles with

feeling stressed at work now joining me

today is Cal Newport Cal Newport is a

professor of computer science at

Georgetown University but Cal is best

known for his New York Times

best-selling books about the

intersection of Technology productivity

and work culture his books have sold

millions of copies and been translated

into 40 languages his newest one is

called slow productivity accomplishment

without burnout but perhaps most

impressively Cal has made it this far in

life without ever starting a social

media account Yes you heard that

correctly if that blows your mind well

once you listen to the conversation

you'll understand how he does it 20

million books sold zero [ __ ] given it's

the subtle art of not giving a [ __ ]

podcast with your host Mark

Manson Cal so good to have you here mark

good to be here I'm excited to do this

for a couple reasons one is just I've

been reading your books for 12 years now

been a fan of your work for a long time

also excited because I feel like

philosophically we're we're very aligned

like every time I read your stuff I'm

like that totally dovet tales with with

what makes sense to me but there's so

many situations where my intuition seem

diametrically opposed to yours so I

actually feel like this is a new podcast

so you might have the honor of being the

first podcast gu that that we get to

disagree about things I like it and have

a conversation about it so I'm very

excited about it the new book is slow

productivity it's fantastic it's clear

it's to the point it's classic Cal

Newport why don't we start by just

laying some groundwork defining some

terms and start out by just telling us

what is slow productivity and what was

the inspiration for the concept well I

mean it's the answer to a question which

is how can we produce work we care about

that's impactful and successful right

support supports us supports our family

without burning out and without having

work Annex more and more of the

territory of your life right that was

the motivating question I was hearing

that from my readers and then I was

feeling it myself as well and you know

for me that the personal motivation was

my three boys all became Elementary

School age which I discovered as a dad

is a real switch suddenly when you have

three boys their Elementary School age

they want essentially every single

minute you can give them which is

different than when they're younger and

it's more like survival mode let's let's

keep these things fed right so it's

really different so I was feeling that

at the same time that in my career I was

hitting on all cylinders you know as an

academic as a writer you know tenure at

Georgetown writing for the New Yorker

books were coming well so I I had

endless opportunities and so I was

feeling that personally then the

pandemic hits and all my readers write

and said I'm tired of the word

productivity and I'm tired of work and

this whole thing is nonsense I just

spent eight hours in zoom and I'm going

to quit and move to the countryside and

we'll figure out later how I'm going to

survive myself all this was going on at

the same time and so I said okay we have

to solve this problem like how can we

work and do interesting work and

meaningful work and not burn out or just

want to leave it all behind move to the

country so slow productivity that's the

answer it's it's what I came up with as

an answer to that question and how would

you define slow productivity well so we

have to Define it in contrast to what we

do instead so I mean I went deep in sort

of C Port fashion I went deep on the the

history of productivity and knowledge

work right and I I think the story is

important to understand what slow

productivity means is that you go all

the way back to Mid 20th century

knowledge work emerges as a major sector

right the term is coined in 1959 there's

a problem this a new type of work we're

using our brain we're not building

things with our hands it's growing

really big we see this in the US economy

the problem is we didn't know how to

Define productivity like because we were

coming out of the Industrial Age in

which we had very clear understanding of

productivity it was a ratio we produced

this many modalities for this many input

labor hours that's a number we change

the way we build the model T's that

number goes up this is better and so you

you had a a very straightforward notion

of productivity that actually came from

agriculture we got this many bushels of

wheat from this many acres of land we

switched the way we rotate our crops

that number went up this is more

productive none of that worked at

knowledge work right because I'm going

to do five or six different things

that's going to be different than what

you're doing uh that's going to shift

unpredictably the method by which I

actually complete my work is entirely

off uscad no one has any idea how I'm

doing it there's no Central system to

even evaluate so we were left with a

quandry how do we Define productivity we

need something right we have to manage

these people and what the industry came

up with was we'll use activity as like a

crude proxy for useful effort sure yeah

activity is better than less activity

more is better than less I call it

pseudo productivity and it was an

activity based notion this kind of

worked because we had offices we went to

and you would go there and you would do

the show and you know you put the

magazine down when the boss walked by

and whatever and then we get to the 20th

century and we get the front office it

Revolution now we have computers we have

networks we have emails we have

smartphones we have laptops suddenly the

opportunities to demonstrate activity

are endless because I can send an email

anywhere at any time the threshold on

what active means really went up because

I can constantly be on slack like I can

constantly be leaving a digital Trail

and the amount of work that was possible

to do also became basically Limitless

that's when the wheels really spun off

uh the car yeah and that's when pseudo

productivity became increasingly

unbearable till we get to the pandemic

and that's it I love this term pseudo

productivity because you know

occasionally I will interface with very

large corporations and it's funny

because I'll go into a meeting and in my

head there's like five minutes of things

to talk about but for people who are

working at a large company you know a

90-minute meeting with Mark Manson

sounds productive it sounds like they're

doing something really important right

and so you end up in this meeting and

it's it's like eight or nine people half

of which probably don't need to be there

in the first place going one by one

giving like a 10 or 12 minute spiel

about something that's completely

inconsequential but sounds important it

sounds useful and it finally it takes 80

minutes to actually get to the the five

minute thing that is of any productive

value whatsoever and it it kills me

inside you know as a self-employed

person an entrepreneur it it just it

drives me absolutely insane but I love

that you point at the the ambiguity of

measurement within knowledge work right

like it's easy if you're a plumber you

can measure your productivity by how

many syns you fix per day but if you are

a writer for instance do you measure by

how many words you write per day do you

measure by how many hours you put in per

day do you measure by how many chapter

outlines like I ran into this myself

with my books where it's like I would

set word counts goals and quickly what

you discover is that you'll just write

[ __ ] to fill up your word count call

and then call call yourself call it a

good day you know pat yourself on the

back and then I was like okay that's not

working maybe I'll switch to just put in

three good hours a day and then I would

just sit at my desk for three hours and

not write any words yeah and then call

Pat myself on the back and call it a

good day and so there's this ambiguity

that pervades so many jobs and I think

so much of this problem is just

accurately defining what is the metric

that we're optim in for well I mean I

think the your example about writing is

perfect for getting to the core of the

issue so this idea that what's my daily

metric that's industrial thinking yeah

right so you're thinking okay so what am

I I have to measure something like how

do what am I doing today is it is it

word count is it pages is it yeah time

where I think the right metric for a

writer is measured and this is going to

be quite different on the scale of a

decade okay what books did I publish in

the last 10 years how proud am I of

those books I mean it's why I open slow

productivity with a riter I open it with

John MC John MC is laying on his back on

a picnic table in his backyard in

Princeton New Jersey for five days like

the book opens with five days of John MC

laying on his back doing nothing except

trying to figure out how am I going to

make this massive two-part New Yorker

piece I'm supposed to write about the

pine Barons how am I going to write an

article about this and he sat there for

five days and my point is if we zoomed

into one of those five days with the

pseudo productivity industrial mindset

he say this person's lazy like he's

doing nothing what can he point to but

then you zoom out he's written 29 books

yeah you know pullit surprise two

different books that were finalist for

the national book award his writing for

the New Yorkers incomparable right I

mean he's productive by any reasonable

sort of self-evident definition of

productivity so as a writer like yeah

what did I do I mean my decade began

with this like this is my productivity

metric like this was the first book this

was the start of me wanting to write

serious uh idea fiction books this is

about 12 12 years right so like now I

can evaluate this and I am like okay

what comes next so that's the scale uh

at which I'm thinking about like that's

a very slow productivity mindset uh I

know it's hard and there's a whole we

get into how do you approach work if

ultimately you're going to measure some

things on a scale of a decade but that's

slow productivity this is a classic

situation where my heart loves that I'm

like yeah that sounds great your brain

is not so and my brain is like wait a

second time out that can work for us as

authors like that's a little bit of a

luxury position right and and John M MC

as well you know what if you are a data

analyst at a bank yeah you know which is

also knowledge work also ambiguous

metrics kpis that you're supposed to

meet maybe they're good maybe they're

not maybe they're driving you crazy

burning you out but they don't have that

luxury to necessarily measure their

productivity in a decade so this this is

the the kind of the key of the approach

in the book is let's start by looking at

what I call traditional knowledge

workers so the people well before we had

cubicles and computer screens used their

brain to create stuff with value now the

thing about traditional knowledge work

so writers philosophers like scientists

artists right the thing about them is uh

they had huge flexibility right I mean

if you are supported by the meta chees

to do statue carving right you have a

lot of flexibility in how you work and

so my thought is well this is an

interesting natural experiment what

happens when you give a knowledge worker

a cognitive worker complete flexibility

how are you going to figure out you can

do anything you want through trial and

error where do you end up what

principles do you end up embodying to

produce uh the best stuff to have the

most sustainable interesting career and

then my idea is we isolate those

principles and then we adapt them to the

data analyst right so we look at me

writing books over a decade or we look

at you know uh Newton taking 30 years to

get the principia together or Lyn Manuel

Miranda spending seven years to do in

the Heights and we don't try to

replicate their daily work habits we

don't say great as a data analyst you

should go be like Linn Manuel Miranda uh

and you should kind of come back to it

every few months and then uh be in a

freestyle uh rap touring group for the

rest of your time like we're not

replicating the specifics but let's

isolate the principles they discovered

and then adapt them so like let's take

this principle which I would call take

longer right take longer on your work

take longer uh the scales in which you

measure productivity you know make that

make that a longer scale you have a

standard knowledge work job what that

then mean is okay when it comes time for

me to agree to a project let me take

whatever timeline I initially think of

as reasonable like all right boss I'll

get you this report in a month and just

automatically double it right because

you're probably really bad at estimating

how much time we see this principle of

great creators is that like they take

their time if you give yourself more

time actually it's not only going to be

more realistic it's probably going to be

a better report or a better marketing

strategy or whatever is you're putting

together so you can take longer now it

doesn't mean sit on your back and picnic

table for 5 days but it might be this is

going to take two months instead of one

and now you're able to produce something

that really turns heads and this gets

the flywheel going the momentum going so

it's all about adapting these examples

to Modern jobs are you familiar with the

Hoff stats law a project will take 50

50% longer than expected even when you

account for Hoff st's law yeah that's

about right I'm a big fan of that so

this is a classic example

philosophically absolutely and I have I

have Absol found in my own career

slowing down doing fewer things which is

the first principle of of slow

productivity do fewer things say no to

more things it's been a huge help in my

own career but then I try to like start

actually like you know carving out where

the boundry between that and just

straight up procrastination you know

where does that end and procrastination

begin if I go to my boss and I say hey

that thing you said to have in a month

I'm going to I'm going to do it in two

like do I actually need those two months

am I bullshitting myself I don't know

it's very murky for me do you is there

any way to like clarify that yeah I mean

well hey this is the challenge of doing

interesting stuff with your brain yeah

right so like let's let's emphasize all

this as hard but like let's talk about

the procrastination issue uh the story

in the book that was relevant here is

the Beatles right so I mean I tell the

story of Sergeant Pepper because what's

interesting about that album is The

Beatles had had this terrible tour right

before that everything went wrong right

and at the very final stop of that tour

they said this is it we're not touring

which is a a big thing when it comes to

thinking about recording an album

because if you're going to tour your

songs have to be reproducible on stage

like in an arena where everyone's going

to recognize the song If you're not

going to tour again you can do anything

you want with the music so now they're

in this situation of we could stay in

the studio as long as we want like we

can endlessly mess with tape loops and

effects and uh Indian instruments and

all the things they did so now you're in

this interesting tension of we want to

do more interesting things than our

first album which they recorded in a

single day yeah which is crazy they just

went in the studio boom boom boom they

had it completely practice they've been

playing those songs in ham they boom

boom boom they're right out the door uh

so we want to do better than that but we

also don't want to be stuck in here you

know endlessly which by the way a lot of

bands ended up doing right they kicked

off the progressive rock movement a lot

of bands especially in the 70s just got

lost in the studio U so how did they

walk to balance between it well they

they did spend more time but they also

set uh Milestones that made them

actually ship things right so like they

they released a single as soon as they

had a single ready to release this

started the clock ticking of okay this

album has to follow like you have a

single out so so they felt okay we have

some pressure to actually keep moving

but we're moving at slower pace so you

should take two months instead of one

because I can I know one month is not

enough time yeah I've never met a

knowledge worker who has ever accurately

estimated how long something was going

to take I mean what people do is they

they create a fairy tale about one in it

great if I could finish this book

chapter in a month and then your mind

falls in love with how everything in

your life would make sense if you could

just but it's not what's actually going

to happen so make it two months but not

three I'm taking more time but not

endless time and what's my equivalent as

a knowledge worker of releasing a single

hold me to it boss yeah this is I'm

going to send you updates along the way

this is going to be good you're going to

like it hold me to it there's a cost now

so okay that that helps me conceptualize

this because one thought that I that I

had a it recurred throughout me reading

this was this idea of like limitations

and constraints can actually improve

productivity and it sounds like what

you're saying is don't just kick the can

down the road like still have a deadline

still put a constraint on just allow for

an an extra amount of leeway than you

might do naturally or normally I mean

this is what Lind Mel Miranda did in

that example right so he has this play

he writes it as a sophomore because you

know he's a brilliant guy so he writes

in the Heights as a sophomore at swore

they perform it's not very good because

also he's a a sophomore but he's like

there's something here right I mean I

think there's something here I need to

mature creatively but I think there's

something here so he didn't just sit on

it and say Let Me Wait Till I'm inspired

but he also didn't say what I'm going to

do is like disappear for three months

and like finish this thing because it

would not have debuted on Broadway and

won eight Tony if he had done that he

did the middle so he got connected with

two alums from swathmore who saw the

play and said I think you're on to

something like your book is kind of

trash uh but the music is really

interesting like so there's something

here and they said here's what we're

going to do they had a theater company

in Manhattan they said we're going to

every couple of months stage a new

reading we're going to bring in actors

and actresses we'll pay for it and we're

going to do a reading and you're going

to really get a sense about what's

working and not working from actually

hearing people read the script and then

you better update it before the next

reading comes along right you need to

actually act on it right so he had these

Milestones that pulled him forward but

he was also touring with his uh

freestyle group he was doing some

substitute teaching he was writing a a

restaurant review column like he wasn't

just doing that yeah so he was taking

time to let that really mature but at

the same time he wasn't uh he wasn't

sitting there and saying I'll get to

this when I feel inspired so it sounds

like this principle of do fewer things

isn't necessarily do less work it's work

really hard on fewer things over a

longer period of time yeah so do fewer

things there's there's another bit of

the logic to it as well which which I

think is clear when I add two words to

it and say do fewer things at once okay

that makes sense fewer things at once

actually means that your rate of

completing things is probably going to

go up yeah right so like this one gives

palpitations to people with bosses

because they interpret it as like I'm

going to do less stuff and they they see

it typically through a standard sort of

Zero Sum employer manager relation like

you would have in the the labor politics

of the industrial sector you know I I as

the the employee in the factory what

makes my life better is going to make

your life as the factory owner worse and

what makes the factory owner's life

better is going to make my life as the

employe worse we're going to fight right

and we're going to have to just go back

and forth It's not that situation

actually in this case doing fewer things

at once is actually going to produce

more things and and the the reason for

that actually it's like really insu and

subtle it is the administrative overhead

that comes along along with saying yes

to something yes right so so once you

say yes to something there's an

administrative overhead in an office

that's going to be emails that's going

to be I get shutters thinking about it

but standing meetings like I don't know

I'm also an academic so you don't have

to deal with this as much but they like

great we meet every Wednesday to talk

about this everything generates that

yeah right which is fine like you have

to there's overhead with commitments you

got to talk to people about it the issue

is that's generated whether you're

working on that at the moment or not so

if you say yes to too many things

they're each generating this overhead

tax that begins to pile up right and

then once that begins piling up the time

left in your day to actually execute the

work gets smaller and smaller and more

fragmented because these meetings aren't

going to All Fall one after another

they're going to fall sprinkle

throughout your day so now the the pace

at which you're actually completing

things goes down so how long does it

take in between things you finish that

actually begins to get longer so if you

keep fewer things on your plate at once

it's not that fewer things get done

actually it goes faster so I always tell

people if you start there it's okay

because once you bootstrap doing fewer

things your boss is going to say why are

you so productive like it's actually

going to be the opposite thing like hey

what's going on here yeah like you're

shipping at a pretty fast rate I believe

it I've actually I found that with my

own team I actually had a sit down with

one of my employees maybe six months ago

and I I told her I'm like you're doing

too much like you you're good at five

things I need you to be excellent at one

interesting and it's it was really

effective it's been really helpful I

think it's I have definitely seen as my

team has grown I have seen the

importance of specialization you know

cuz when you're small and it's just two

or three people everybody wears a lot of

hats and the stakes are a little bit

lower but now that we're growing quite a

bit I'm finding that I'm having to have

these conversations of like you are

going to be the team expert at this one

thing yeah and the you are in charge of

this domain and it's it's been great

it's been really effective do that well

I mean this is like software developers

figur this out a long time ago like we

want you to write this type of code that

you write really well right that's why

software developers figured out a while

ago we're not just going to push tasks

on people we're not just going to say

here's like 20 features we need in the

just hey take care of these no we're

going to use some sort of agile system

where if there's a feature that needs to

be done we'll write it down on a board

and it's not on your plate and it's not

on my plate it's on the team's plate

it's generating no overhead tax because

no one is assigned to this yet and then

we're going to give you one thing at a

time yeah and just like Sprint do that

thing you know all the 10x code this and

when you're done we're going to give you

another thing right they they discovered

programs get built faster and better

that way than just dropping everything

on everyone at once and like just hey

figure this all out and you know add all

these features and keep up with them so

one of the recurring subjects that

happens throughout the book is remote

work it kind of you never I don't think

you ever completely address it directly

but it's it continually shows up as

examples uh particularly over the last

few years since the pandemic and I was

thinking that this concept of the

overhead tax which I love and it's a

completely accurate way of thinking

about it I think there's something about

digital work

that deludes us it makes the the

overhead tax less apparent yeah like if

you come to me in person and you're like

hey Mark I'm doing this event it'd be

really cool if you showed up if for some

reason you know we can talk about it I

can ask like okay what are your

expectations how many days is it how

long is the talk you know all these

things and I can get a really good sense

of like okay how much time in my

schedule is that going to take up

whereas if I get an email from a random

company or organization saying hey come

out to Indiana and come speak to a

thousand people and we're going to pay

you a shitload of money for some reason

that email just looks like easy money

and like just on paper I'm like oh man

this is this is the best deal ever and

what for some reason my brain is not

processing that this is we're going to

have multiples zo meetings I'm going to

have to fly out like 2 days early

there's going to be a meeting with uh

with the organizers there's going to be

a meeting with the VIPs there's going to

be a sound check there's going to be a

lunch there's going to be the VIP launch

there's going to be a reception there's

going to be a book signing my flight's

going to get delayed coming back it's

actually it's like a 4-day commitment

and and it's actually not worth it and

it took me a long time to start saying

no to those things part of me wonders

like what is it about digital work in

particular that that ofu skates the

overhead tax I mean I think it matters

you're not seeing someone yeah right I

mean the the friction little reductions

in friction can make a big difference

right I mean there there's a a study

that Gloria Mark did where they went to

a company and they took 12 people and

they turned off their email it's like

one of these cool Gloria Mark studies of

like let's unplug this wire and Happ see

what breaks right yeah but then she told

me a a backstory about the study which I

think gets to this is that one of the

subjects in the study told her like not

in the paper but told her that he was

really annoyed at his boss in general

because he had this job where he had to

set up a laboratory for experiments

every day it was an R&D lab and the boss

would just keep emailing him with like

hey do this can you just do this like

get me this no just give me what did you

get the email did you get the email and

he was really annoyed because it would

keep distracting him from what he was

doing and it was kind of intricate what

he was doing then they selected that guy

to be one of the no email people in the

subject in the study the boss

essentially stopped bothering him and

then what would Gloria would say the

reason why this is interesting is the

boss's office was like three doors down

from the laboratory this guy was setting

up so like the boss could just walk down

the hallway and asked this guy hey could

you do this what about this that extra

little friction that was the difference

yeah right it like substantially cut

down there's something about you know

like if I pitched you right now come to

Indiana yeah it's just like you're

saying I want you to come give a and

I've done exactly this in Indiana so I

know we've probably done it for the same

company been there done that yeah we'

probably done for the same company

you're in person a I'd be much more

reluctant to ask you because I can watch

I mean I know it sounds small but like

asking someone to do something you have

to watch their face and the

consternation and there's like a social

capital there's a risk of feeling the

rejection it's easy like if you don't

get an email back it doesn't really

bother you but when you stand face to

face with somebody and ask them

something and they're like no like it

sucks it does suck and yeah and I think

that that is true right uh so so you get

that with the digital so you're like

okay I don't care if I send this out you

know because what happens they're going

to say no um you also have to see the

context right so you know when I see you

in your office I see you're doing things

so I'm thinking like well Mark's kind of

busy like okay may I'm not going to

bother him about this on email for

whatever reason or slack the the way we

imagine other people is basically like

empty vessels to do our work so like we

imagine like you're just sitting there

oh my entire team is nodding along right

now exact

and especially like the Killer is not

necessarily the trip to Indiana it's

going to take four days it's the thing

that's going to take like 45 minutes of

your time because they imagine like come

on why not what are you doing right now

like I do things that take 45 minutes

all the time and they don't understand

you're busy or the scale of how many

people are asking or even five minutes

like it's a dozens of five minute things

and there's there's something to there's

like a there's a cognitive load that

comes with task switching yep and so

when you are always available and when

everything seems minor and easy and you

just get inundated constantly with a 5-

minute thing here and a 5- minute thing

there it wears you out in a way that I

mean this is this is a lot of what deep

work is about it wears you out in a way

that you know working four hours on one

thing does not uh and this is I think is

like the productivity poison yeah is

like the fact that the human brain is

not a microprocessor right like a

microprocessor every op that it executes

every op code is the same as far as it's

concerned it just here it goes It goes

to the circuits takes exactly one cycle

give me the next thing so all that

matters for a processor is you want to

make sure that it's never idle so if you

design a processor like all of us

computer scientists had to do in school

you want to keep a pipeline as full as

possible of instructions so that like

it's never idle human brain can't do

that like if I want to switch from what

we're doing now to talk about or think

about something unrelated I have to do a

lot of cognitive work I mean and it it

goes down to the neuronal level I have

to inhibit certain networks that are

relevant to this conversation I have to

excite different neuronal networks that

are relevant to the conversation this

can take 10 to 20 minutes it's why when

you sit down to do something hard it's

this sucks this sucks this sucks o I'm

in flow now right like 15 minutes in

like why is that because it takes about

15 minutes for your brain to

reconfigure to what you're doing and

then it goes easy so yeah so what

happens when you have to switch every

five minutes you always feel like in the

first 10 minutes of trying to write like

everything is just frustrating your

cognitive capacity is reduced it's

deranging like could completely exhaust

people it's like working in an

environment with weird flashing lights

and it's like too cold like it's not

conducive to how humans actually

function like I I really do think

constant context switching is like the

number one mental health Affliction of

knowledge work right like it's a massive

issue and it's something that technology

to the point of digital Min minimalism

it's something that technology enables

further there are a couple themes here

that keep coming up on the Pod with

multiple people so like when Oliver

burkman was on a we spent a lot of time

talking about how removing friction

actually can in some cases make things

worse and with him it was more in in

kind of like a philosophical existential

sense like it's without friction things

don't feel as meaningful they don't feel

as important when David Brooks was on we

talked about how the loss of social

friction is actually makes relationships

more superficial and more you know more

tenuous and here we're seeing it with

with productivity like that that lack of

friction is actually in some ways kind

of overloading our brains

so when I was doing research for this

episode I came across something really

fascinating I looked up job satisfaction

surveys and I was surprised really

surprised according to the conference

board job satisfaction survey 2023 marks

the highest job satisfaction since the

survey began almost 40 years ago uh it

measured job satisfaction across 26

categories and it found that the gain

and job satisfaction was most marked in

people who had hybrid or remote work

let's put a pin in that next thing I

looked up burnout burnout is also at an

all-time high 61% of workers say that

they find it difficult to unplug and

stop working at home 77% of remote

workers say that they feel isolated and

41% say that they do not feel supported

by their bosses or co-workers one study

found that on average remote workers

spend 2 and 1 half hours more per day

working which is that's staggering

that's over that's like a 52-hour work

week so we have this like weird

contradiction going on here

of if you ask people how satisfied they

are with their jobs they they're more

satisfied than ever and the people who

are working from home or have the option

to work from home say that report that

they are the most satisfied than ever

but they are also the most burnt out all

the remote work of all the workers

period so what the [ __ ] is going on here

I I know these data right partially

what's going on here is people like

flexibility yeah right so so many

different surveys ask people this is not

surprising would you rather have

flexibility in your schedule or a

schedule that you have no flexibility

nine out of 10 I'm thinking of recent

Gallop data will say I want flexibility

like it's like asking do you want

Sunshine totally yeah right um so when

you ask a newly hybrid or remote worker

are you satisfied with your job I

honestly think a lot of that answer is I

don't want you to take this flexibility

back away yeah so I'm going to say this

like they they see the question as a as

a quorum you know they're asking you um

do you you like having this flexibility

like no it's good it's good don't take

it back right and that's a lot of the

dynamic right now is people who uh

gained hybrid or remote work schedules

don't want it to go back actually right

now what's ended up dominating is hybrid

you I was just looking over these

numbers uh we had fully remote of course

in remote capable jobs like jumped and

dominated in March of 2020 onsite fell

all the way down to 12% onsite came up a

little bit like it never got back above

20 and it's been there ever since right

so like we basically got rid of of

on-site jobs for jobs that didn't have

to be on site in knowledge work the real

shift is remote and hybrid remote just

fell fell fell hybrid rose rose rose

hybrid is now two times more prevalent

than fully remote so like we're in a

hybrid world now and no one wants to not

have the option yeah yeah but they're

also really burning out yeah right so

hybrid work remote work whatever

combination you have it brings with it

these friction issues we're talking

about it also brings with it the issue

of we get more meetings yes and virtual

meetings because if I can grab you in

the hallway then we don't have to set up

a zoom if we set up a zoom because we're

both at home or one of us is at home and

one of us isn't that's going to eat up

30 minutes on my schedule because I

don't have the dexterity to drag like a

smaller thing on Google Calendar than 30

minutes so now you're taking what might

have been 15 total minutes of ad hoc

conversation and now it's going to be

two and a half hours of Zoom meeting and

this is really deranging for people as

well yeah again it is a concept that

keeps showing up over turn over is

people like a lack of friction it on

some level makes them happy but it

produces worse results in terms of just

overall well-being mental well-being

it's really interesting to not to get

too philosophical but you know when I

was thinking about this I've been

thinking a lot about Jean Paul sart he

had this idea as one does yeah of course

like what else do you do on a Tuesday

Morning get existential

sure but s you know he he described that

as a good Frenchman he said free was

anxiety and Terror and you know at the

time that was just very I don't know

edgy of him to say but the older I get

and the more all of this technology

develops the more I see the wisdom of

that of how giving people endless

optionality is actually in some sense

emotionally overwhelming and cognitively

taxing to use your word like it is a tax

and it's a subtle tax I don't think we

recognize it when it's happening when

we're scrolling on Instagram or browsing

through Netflix or opening our email and

like scanning through the 200 emails

that just came in like our conscious

perception is wow look at all this

amazing stuff that's available to me

what's actually happening behind the

scenes is very taxing and draining it's

like the Netflix effect right I mean you

go on Netflix today and like I can't

find something to watch because when the

options are endless you're like there's

got to be some sort of Perfect movie

that's like going to match my emotional

state slin of the day SL I heard about

this thing also has this actor in it if

I can't find that I'm not happy whereas

15 years ago you could basically take a

random thing that you select on Netflix

and if it was on TBS and you were home

that night you like this is great this

is kind of interesting look like Vince

Von's in it okay I don't know like it's

gonna be funny I don't we were happier

yeah yeah or or like when I was a kid

and probably the same right remember the

9s it was like we're going to go to the

movies every weekend and it's like okay

you know there'll be something that

seems like kind of okay and it was fun

like some things were like fine some

weren't it probably be a movie with like

Harrison Ford jumping off something and

it was like fine and we really loved it

and we were happy and now we're on Max

like oh there's only like 20 Oscar

winners here I don't know this is

[ __ ] that's this is two and a half

hours I don't have enough time for that

so imagine like in the workplace one of

the ultimate uh flexibilities we gave

people in knowledge work is we said okay

productivity itself I figure that out

how do you organize your work figure

that out you can do anything you want

you know it's a we'll just throw stuff

at you and you have to figure out like

how are you going to make sense of

everything like why leave that

completely up to every worker and you

would say like well options are better

but I think exactly it's the the start

right over again right it completely

paralyzes people absolutely yeah like I

have to figure out how I say yes how I

say no how I keep track of what I'm

doing how I decide what to do next how I

you know every time I do a video that's

even remotely you know hey here's a a

productivity related thing you could do

those numbers fly through the roof

because there's so many people out there

like oh my God I don't know what what to

do it's Netflix all over again it is

fascinating how much this topic has

blown up since the pandemic and it's I

it's funny because at first I thought it

was that everybody was at home and had

nothing to do and so they were they

suddenly became all very aware of all

their bad habits and yes all of their

worst tendencies that might be part of

it but as it keeps going I have to

believe that this is part of it too that

it's it's the remote work and the weird

kind of paradox of increased flexibility

versus feeling like you're running in

place all the time feeling like

nothing's actually getting done and the

burnout that comes along with that I

think some of the best practical tips in

the book come from this section of like

even if you have a boss even if you're

working in a huge company even if you've

got like 20 people who under you who are

relying on you like here are some

practical tidbits that you can do to

slow things down yeah to take things off

your plate can you run through a couple

of those really quick yeah and most of

them come back to the Practical tips in

that section making your workload more

transparent it's almost like psychology

hacking in some sense like one of the

the the issues that keeps too much work

coming on your plate and you saying yes

too much is other people don't know what

you're doing again so they see you as a

vessel to do their work and they're

offended why would you say no like an

idea in there that was actually meant as

a thought experiment but people that I

talked to about this on the podcast are

actually doing it so it's fascinating

like it's maybe not a thought experiment

is have a shared document right and at

the top of it is here's like the three

things I'm working on right now in like

a divider line all right here's the

queue of things I'm going to work on

next like that I've that I've agreed to

now when someone comes along and it's

like hey can you do this and it's you

know it's not like an obvious no it's

it's from your boss or whatever like

yeah of course just add it throw it on

the Queue and and like you know if there

is information I need to know to execute

it you can put it there or you can just

put a reminder to say like you know to

call you when it gets closer or whatever

throw it on the Queue oh and by the way

you can check in anytime you want to see

where that thing is as it works its way

up oh and you want it to be done fast

that's great like you're the boss you

know just tell me which of the things so

what are we moving yeah you you know

better than I like which one are we

moving down I'll let them know you know

and it it forces a confrontation with

the reality of workload and and you

would think something like this would be

kind of preposterous or you know a boss

like what are you talking about but if

you do this

nicely it's actually really effective

like oh okay I see what you're doing

you're working on these things you know

what don't worry about this right

because it's going to take you too long

to get to this anyways I'll I'll give it

to someone else or we just won't do it

or now that I see what you're doing can

we take these three things back off your

plate I don't want you doing those it's

like your employee I don't want you

doing those three things like these type

of things are more important oh I see

what's getting in the way of you doing

this which you're really good at so you

know what tell these people you're not

doing that I want you just to be working

on this transparency unlocks a a lot of

good things and ausc unlocks a lot of

frustration hearing you say that it

makes me wonder how much of this issue

is that if you're in person or let's say

you're in a blue collar job you're on a

construction side or something you can

physically see what everybody's doing

you can talk to someone you can see if

they seem like flustered or overloaded

there's an emotional intangible

communication that happens in person

where as a group you can kind of

prioritize and sort tasks by what's most

valuable and each given moment and

there's not an argument about it there's

no there's no ambiguity about it whereas

when you go digital you don't have that

extra non-verbal communication you don't

actually see that Jon's like working his

ass off or busy with eight other things

so it makes sense that Building Systems

with with that explicit purpose would

solve a lot of these issues I was a big

fan of the push versus pull processes

that's actually that's the section that

I hit and I was like oh my God I'm

totally going to use this that's the way

all work should be done by the way pull

not push yes yeah will not push is like

how all knowledge work should be

assigned and almost none is can you

describe each one of those and what it

looks like yeah and this comes out of

manufacturing right so you know in

manufacturing a push system would be as

soon as I'm done with this step of the

manufacturing process I push it onto the

next person right this doesn't work out

very well because uh I can't control the

speed at which things are being pushed

on me and you can get pileups right so

what works better is a pull based system

when I'm ready to do the next thing I'll

pull it from you no one gets piled up

so basically the slowest step of the

chain in this particular setup dictates

the speed but then what really happens

in these systems is then you can pretty

clearly identify oh great this is the

slowest one we can put more resources

there and the whole system speeds up no

pileups though this is how knowledge

work should be assign but it's not we

push something comes into my world it's

now a source of stress for me like a

client called me was like we gotta you

know whatever we got to get this feature

whatever added to the software I want to

get this off my plate as soon as

possible because you know productivity

is personal and I'm not very organized

and it's just in my head and it stresses

me out so I'm just going to push it onto

someone else's plate so I can just be

like Mark take care of the feature

exclamation point emoji sin boom it's

off my plate right it took me like seven

seconds and just on now I've pushed it

onto your plate now you have to deal

with it so now you're pushing other

things on other people's plates so all

the work that comes into the system gets

pushed on someone's plate it's all

unevenly distributed and we get the

whole overt tax issue right a poll-based

system in knowledge work would be okay

things that need to be done Exist by

default not on an individual person's

plate like we have a place to keep track

of as a team these are things that need

to be done so the client calls me hey we

got to have this feature whatever I put

it to our list of these are things we

need to do it's not on my plate it's not

on your plate then what individuals do

is as they finish something they pull

something more from that list and you

can do this intelligently like let's

let's have a quick meeting or whatever

to figure out we have a standup meeting

how they do it in software development

okay you're done with with this what's

the best thing for you to do next well

now that we're really looking at this

like we should really give this priority

okay will you take that on next and it

gives you an opportunity to say okay if

I'm going to do this I'm gonna need this

from you and this from you and this from

you and you can kind of figure it out

right then yeah okay not a lot of emails

okay make sure I get that by Tuesday

let's write this down you're doing that

all right this draft will be ready for

you to check by Wednesday I'll put it in

this Dropbox and you do that and I'll

come back to it on you figure out the

whole plan and then you go and do that

thing and it gets executed like that is

the right way to leverage cognitive

resources not just oh my God like let's

just email these things them off you

know it's just obligation Hot Potato I

got to get this stuff off my plate right

now because I'm stressed totally and I

temporarily feel better and I just made

20 people feel worse and they're going

to retaliate they're going to retaliate

it's like no you get this and you know

you get this sometimes where people will

send you an email and you know that

there's not enough information there for

you to do it you know it's not you know

it's going to get bounced back they know

it's going to get bounced back but in

the moment they were just trying to get

that they're trying to get it out of

their inbox yeah because they feel like

oh if I can just clear my inbox I I'm

done for the day I'm done for the day

yeah us said nonsense he I love this

because uh a pain point in my business

right now is you know we've completely

pivoted the video and everything relies

on the video production so are are you

filming this oh

man cut to me and a yeah right I should

have an elaborate wig

[Laughter]

on oh um but yeah everything in the

business now relies on the video content

being produced so the social content

that we put out the the way we promote

things the promotions that go into the

newsletters and so if a and video

production is very hard and complex and

very labor intensive so when things get

stuck in the video

pipeline everything gets like backed up

in the rest of the business and I've

been talking to my my lead people like

how do we solve this how do we get over

and so as as soon as I saw the push pull

thing I'm like oh my God this is amazing

all right so let's get to where I think

we might disagree principle number two

is work at a natural pace what the [ __ ]

is a natural

pace not not like you're in the Ford

factory okay not okay full intensity 9

to5 five days a week 50 weeks 50 weeks a

year no variation in intensity work is

turn it on you should be working really

hard till it's over that was not how

humans work through all of our history

until we invented Mills in factories and

then when we tried to put people into

that type of work it was so unnatural

and so terrible that we had to invent

labor unions and giant regulatory

Frameworks just to try to make this type

of artificial work somewhat tolerable

and then knowledge work comes along and

what do we do like how do we organize

this like oh let's do what the factory

does yeah yeah show up 9 to five let's

go so a natural pace is inherently

variable variable okay so there's like

Sprints yes periodic bursts at different

time scales too yes within the day

within the week within the month within

the year like the summer is slower than

the fall this day is more intense than

that day the morning's more intense I

early in the afternoon or within a

career I assume yeah you could go that

wide as well yeah because as I was

reading through this section I kept

thinking of counter examples like you

mentioned the Beatles earlier they did

12 albums in nine years yeah which is an

insane amount of output they never

stopped working yeah they never stop

like never which is completely atypical

you know there there are other musicians

that like you talk about Jewel in the

book you know took slowed down canceled

opportunities took her time with albums

you know like really honed her craft and

and also was massively successful turned

down a million dollars didn't just slow

down without homeless at the time turned

down the million dollars so that she

could take more time and make 200

million couple years down the line yeah

juel if you're out there come on the Pod

so that the variability of it makes more

sense to me I couldn't help but feel and

I guess this this goes without saying

but a certain amount of this is probably

personality driven as well I imagine

some people's natural setting is a

little bit higher or lower than other

people's and I say that just because I

maybe maybe I'm a workaholic in denial

and and this is like is this therapy now

this is like triggering to me you'll be

okay Mark you'll be okay but I no I I

really thought about this and because I

I came across some examples and I'm I'm

curious what your response would be so

we we got the Beatles Mark Twain did 94

books in 55 years Picasso if you average

out Picasso's output he averaged almost

a painting a day in his adult life these

guys had huge variation in their

day-to-day intensity yes Mark Twain was

not writing N9 to5 every week I mean he

would go on these trip like I'm G to go

like I'm GNA go to California to like

write an article about California that's

like five days on the train you know and

then like he's there for three weeks and

then he comes back this is like John MC

he wrote 29 books but also he spent five

laying on his back like just thinking

about when you uh compress a career you

imagine this is what happens is you

think about like kind of working on all

those things at the same time right

Picasso had huge diversions you know

where he was like let me try this or

that uh this movies happens all the time

too like your directors right like wow

they have this great filmography there's

often like some exceptions just like

years for like n nothing was really

getting made I was going back to the

creative well I'm glad you bring this up

and I kind of interrupted but I just no

no no I

I want to hear your this I was thinking

about this during the book yeah because

like in variations in intensity m is

completely compatible with like killing

it like I'm just like producing great

stuff right like I write a lot of books

but I'm not writing every day I'm not

writing every month years will go by you

know a year will go by where I don't

touch a book at all and then you kind of

recharge and come back it just kind of

gets to a third principle at obsessing

over quality but like slow productivity

a lot of the exemplars of this these

traditional knowledge workers are really

productive yeah right like they're you

look at what they've done and are like

okay I'm just going to like give you a

round of applause yes but they're not

trying to do full intensity every day

because that's impossible you can do it

with pseudo work totally right I can do

email and zoom eight hours a day you

know five days a week 50 because it's

it's busyness right but doesn't it's not

I'm actually not being taxed that much I

can't write at that intensity I can't do

a movie I can't do painting at that

intensity so they're they're all over

the place I may be plated here I'm

trying

no that but that makes sense to me that

at a macro level somebody can be

intensely productive yes there's Peaks

and troughs and variation and again as a

self-confessed workaholic that Maps

pretty well to myself it's funny I go to

my my wife my team I'm like you know

this year this year is a Sprint like I'm

going to go hard this year it's going to

be six day weeks you know whatever there

are other years where I'm like I'm going

to take three months off like I'm

feeling exhausted I need time away so

slow productivity efficient a that's

working at a natural pace so so this

kind of gets back to the point where

it's like philosophically like I think

we're on the same page it's maybe it's

interpretation of the philosophical

precepts so can I propose maybe tell me

if this Rings true like maybe part of

the the instinctual friction because I

get this a lot so I think this this is

worth talking about is the notion of

slowness in our culture is so connected

to sort of anti-product self care

laziness yeah but or well positive spin

it but it's like yeah you're doing be

less productive because there's more to

life than productivity right it's not

what I think about with slow

productivity actually I think about I

want to really produce awesome stuff

like I'm fiercely ambitious you know

like I want to produce really good stuff

and keep getting better this is what

allows you to keep doing it this what

allows you like Picasso to do it 100%

but I think this is the there's another

dominant discourse right now that came

out of the same place which is pseudo

productivity is Terri and people are

exhausted and we're done with being on

Zoom 8 hours a day the other dominant

discourse that came out of this is the

anti-pr movement and that's much more

coming at it from a a perspective of

work as a pejorative and it's more of a

antagonistic relationship between you

and work and you Zero Sum are claiming

more for life outside of work there's

more the life than than work yeah these

type of arguments have never been as

compelling to me because I think that

people who need them

let's just be less hustle I mean like

yes but also like that's a hard sell for

a lot of people so when it's framed that

way it resonates a little bit more you

know the the anti- hustle culture thing

like it's I I agree with you that it's

there's often especially when you're in

one of these Sprint periods you get

outsize gains from taking your foot off

gas for a little while like go take that

4-day weekend and relax by a lake or

something and you'll come back and

you're you're actually twice as

productive as you would have been

otherwise and you make you make up for

the Lost quote unquote lost time totally

get that with this I run into the fear

too of like and maybe it's part of this

I just don't trust myself enough but

like how do we recognize what the

natural pace for us is because I know

for myself and a lot of people I know as

well if I try to allow myself to take

breaks I will sometimes wonder if I'm

being lazy if I'm just avoiding

responsibilities if I'm actually nervous

to try to do something and this is my

way of like trying to avoid it yeah and

then on the converse side like on the

flip side I'm also sometimes when I push

myself super hard I'm like this is

unhealthy I'm probably avoiding

something like I'm very skeptical of my

own ability to accurately gauge what is

natural for myself and so yeah maybe

this is just this is my therapy session

well I mean look I would I would rather

have you have more variation in your

intensity for the wrong reasons yeah

then have you work all out for the wrong

reasons right because working all out is

just not sustainable it's just not

sustainable like it just doesn't work

right so there isn't really an argument

for I could do this like work all out

and have no variation of my pacing and

there's some things I'm losing and some

things I'm gaining no N Net you're going

to just lose sure right it's just going

to it is going to burn you out in the

end because it's it's unnatural right I

mean same thing if you had you know a

relationship with you know food or drugs

or something they were like this is just

not sustainable for like a human body

like okay I'm going to drink heavily

yeah uh and that has its advantages and

it disadvantages like no net net is

going to end up being just all

disadvantages like right now yeah you're

getting advantages out of it like

sociality but give that 20 years like

this is not going to go someplace good

that's what I feel about the allout

working one thing I've talked about

before on this podcast is is that

there's a very fine and blurry line

between hash selfcare and hhag

self-indulgence you know where is that

line where taking the time off backing

off just turns into you know quiet

quitting or whatever yeah so this is why

the third principle obsess over quality

I call that the glue for everything else

this is what makes all that work right

so when you begin to also reorient your

work around doing things really well

like this is the thing I want to do

really well and I'm going to keep

getting better at it like I'm going to

prioritize craft and get better about

something this makes uh all of the other

things I talked about not become

degenerate and go into a weird Direction

so if you don't have the obsess over

quality and all you're working on is I

want to do fewer things and I want more

variation these are all real issues yes

right I mean it's like I don't know

where this is going and you can become

sort of pathological about that I do

nothing yeah I work two days a week I

win the do fewer things and natural pace

or whatever the obsess over quality is

the moderator so I mean I say in the

book without that you're just going to

be engendering a sort of weird

antagonistic relationship with your work

and it's going to go weird places if

you're obsessing over quality a lot of

these issues go away right because now

what's driving you is I want to produce

the next thing I do I want to be great

so I am going to keep working on this

and like why am I having variations

because it feels As Natural to me as

anything else that my quality is

slumping here like this book is not

going to be great I can't just White

Knuckle this like I need to like this

isn't working you know like I need to go

take a week and just think about it and

like walk the beach let me come back to

it again because if I don't this thing's

not going to be good if you don't obsess

over quality and it's just a pseudo

productivity world you're like I don't

know more I could always do more more

and more is always abstractly better so

when you obsess over quality slowness

becomes natural like of course I need to

slow down because this junk is getting

in the way of this like you're not even

convincing yourself uh and then you get

the other Advantage was as you get

better you get more leverage to actually

do more of that so you have this sort of

virtuous cycle so yeah the quality piece

is to Lynch pin people who obsess over

quality don't hashtag selfcare yeah yeah

totally they hashtag here's my tonies

you know what I mean like this is what

they're thinking about but by the way

they probably doing more selfcare than a

lot of just pseudo productivity drenched

knowledge workers because you know I got

to do what works like ly Mel Miranda

needed this play to be great and he

couldn't White Knuckle that yet so he

knew this was going to take time and

it's there's an awareness of like it's

not just about taking care of myself

it's also you're taking care of your own

work because yeah if you White Knuckle

it for too long you start doing bad work

so that that totally makes sense so far

you were Neo in The Matrix with my

objections uh I've got two

more here we go I should have I should

have put more curse words in the title I

thought about it how much of this is

kind of a privileged position like

obsessing over quality in particular

like if you are somebody who's growing

up in poverty just trying to claw your

way out of it do whatever it takes you

know [ __ ] how well the product turns out

like I'm going to work three jobs until

I can get my get the [ __ ] out of here

like where is the boundary on that

Dimension and I use the word privileged

like not in a pejorative way but like

just in an like socioeconomic way of

like is this a middle class white collar

knowledge worker thing college educated

thing or is this more broadly applicable

this book is looking specifically at

this particular economic sector because

this is the economic sector that has

these odd dynamics of complete autonomy

and lack of specificity about how work

unfolds uh complete dependence on

digital tools that allows work to follow

you anywhere you're going these are the

things that came together to create the

pseudo productivity Bur out crisis so

this is very focused on knowledge work

but one of the things I say about that

is knowledge work up to this point

hasn't really had this discussion right

so other sectors of the economy that do

other types of work were often much more

comfortable maybe not solving the

problem but have a vocabulary for

talking about the problem like okay well

this is the problem with like the

service sector for example right there's

a lot of issues with the service sector

right and service sector jobs can be way

worse than anything we're talking about

here right right like having three

service sector jobs where they're doing

algorithmically optimized scheduling

meaning that the Starbucks manager just

calls you and it's like never mind

you're working like one hour this day

and like three hours here uh this is way

worse than I have too many emails but

also in the service sector at least uh

the people who are talking about this

like this is definitely a problem

everyone's like yeah this is a problem

what is this guy you what are you doing

with this and we're going to unionize

now and at least there's a fight going

on knowledge work we don't even have the

fight right it's like no you should just

feel like this is white colar work like

this is you know you're this is It's

creative and you should you're

passionate about this job how could you

complain you your great salary and

benefits and you're working from home

what are you complaining about yeah

exactly right so you don't want to

compare the magnitude of the problems

between sectors because I mean this

sector's got a you work an air

conditioner let's be honest about this

right so you know these are not

strategies for the service sector it's

not strategies for the agriculture

sector for the industrial sector um but

one thing this sector could learn from

all those other sectors is like be

willing to have people to step back and

say there is a problem here let's think

about what it is and like let's talk

about Solutions and let's fight about

the solutions and you know I'm going to

propose this and this person and we just

don't have that discussion at all in

knowledge work well to clarify maybe

what about like at the bottom of the

totem poll of the knowledge worker

sector like you know a a secretary who's

taking an extra job you know doing data

entry or something in the knowledge

sector but at the the lower sectors of

it yeah so hopefully the idea is not

only your job be more sustainable you're

going to move up faster yeah right like

okay what's going on here this job's

entry level is always my advice to

someone entry level knowledge work like

find the two or three things or the one

or two things that you can start

learning how to do really well that then

you're indispensable on that and then

they stop giving you the other things

and that's how you begin to move up I

mean this is the it's like the fallacy

of being an assistant in Hollywood right

you want to be like super competent and

ambitious but not too good

at the small things right if you make

yourself indispensable at I can figure

out that you're dry cleaning you could

pick it up on the way here and I got the

driver going over here they're never

going to let you move up because the

agents if they move you up to be a

junior agent don't need to be good at

that they need to have like some other

attribute and there's this whole

thinking of like okay so I want to get

really good there's that whole game

theory there yeah of like you whatever

it is they care about some shark

attitude but you got to show it right so

I think uh obsessing over quality more

like right away what can I do better

thinking about okay I need some

variation in the book I talk about how

to put variation without telling anybody

without it being notable like right I

have all that advice about Stealth quiet

quitting for just three weeks at a time

like giving yourself secretly variation

so you're not burning out yeah and then

working with transparency of workload

and and trying to the subtler advice for

doing fewer things the hope is that will

move you up quicker than if you're just

like let's just uh rock and roll I'm

just going to be on email all day you're

going to burn yourself out right so so

hopefully if you're into knowledge

sector this is implementable and make

things better yeah my other question was

around young people particularly because

they have the most energy generally and

often they aren't totally aware of what

they want to specialize in or what they

want to get really good at and so there

is an element of like test a bunch of

different things maybe even test a few

different jobs before you go all in on

something yeah like how does that fit

into this yeah I mean if only there was

a book

that that thought more about I thought a

lot about that

um young people spend too much time

doing this yeah and and I'm not saying

you should just throw a dart but also

the the only leverage or Capital you

have in your career and knowledge work

is your skills yes like the things you

can do well that are rare and valuable

that's your leverage and you can alter

those over time you can pick up new ones

but you should be obsessing almost from

day one where is there someplace here in

this entry-level job and I'm xeroxing

things for whatever where is there a

place here where there's something

valuable that like most people at this

level aren't doing well that I can with

laser focus get really good at right it

doesn't mean like what what might that

be if you're at an entry level knowledge

or position xoxy that thing is not going

to be your career 25 years from now

that's going to be what starts moving

you towards options starts exposing more

of the world to you you know it's it's

like uh when you're new in your career

you have these huge blinders on yes you

could survey the world as much as you

want but all you're going to see is like

the reality of the entry-level jobs you

you don't know enough to know what comes

up next or what it really feels like so

you actually have to start climbing the

ladder and at each level it's like

Donkey Kong yeah now I can run over this

platform and go up another ladder but I

don't know what's up there so you have

to how do I get up those ladders quicker

rare and valuable skills yeah if

anything just practice it like in your

first job make it a game I'm going to

choose this thing and within six months

I'm going to be awesome at it just to do

just to practice like what does it feel

like to get really good at something

like what is just the sense memory or

the cognitive sensation up doing that so

I'm a big fan that rare and valuable

skills that's the only currency in the

end knowledge work is the only currency

that really matters and so you want to

have a lot of that so you can kind of

make investments in what you want your

career to be like yeah you want me over

I have no room to talk because I never

had a real job so I mean I mean have I

really I'm a I'm a professor and a

writer speaking of being a professor I'm

curious you know it's fashionable to

trash jiny right now particularly around

things like this around quiet quitting

self-care how they're always on social

media have you

noticed any Trends any differences like

do you think it's over overblown are you

bullish bearish on jenzy what are your

thoughts I'm bullish I mean the look the

students at Georgetown that I teach

they're all brilliant they're all

smarter than I was at that age uh so you

don't really see that carry over uh I

think social media trends are easy to

extrapolate to a generation but often no

it's why what makes a social Med media

Trend to trend is it plays well with the

algorithm and then more and more people

figure that out and it's this weird

cybernetic cont content production Loop

and that now everyone's doing quiet

quitting videos um and then the

algorithm kind of just favored that and

no one talks about quiet quitting

anymore I care less about that the thing

I do worry a little bit about talking to

like my jiny students the attention span

thing is real right I mean I have

students telling me I can't believe that

anyone watches YouTube anymore like

those videos could be like 15 minutes

long like are you kidding me like in a

an age of Tik Tok who is watching

YouTube it's like a a sincere concern

that like a lot of my students have and

so I'm always telling them this could be

really good news for you right like it's

the parable of the bear if you know

you're with your friend and a and a bear

charges you don't have to be faster than

the bear you just have to be faster than

your friend right yeah well it's the

same thing with attention right now I

was like if you opt out like 50% of this

like if you don't use Tik Tok just let's

just do that like if you read as a

college student just compared to the

fragmentation of attention of the people

around you you're going to be like

Einstein people like I cannot believe

that you wrote this whole thing this

whole memo in like three hours or how

did you get so much stuff done how do

you also have these hobbies that are

fulfilling you and so that's the thing I

do care about is the Deep work effect

right yeah is uh I do think digital

media especially in uh nonprofessional

media where jiny has this very

particular phonetic relationship that

could have some ramifications yeah but

it's a very smart generation I agree

I interact you know a significant

percentage of my audience is jiny and I

play a lot of video games um so I

inevitably end up watching you know

these 20-year-olds on Twitch who are

just incredible at games and yeah it's a

hungry generation it is I'm I'm actually

consistently impressed uh by how

thoughtful and aware they are of

everything going on and I agree like

they I I have seen 20 yearolds on Twitch

and Discord say and think about things

that I was nowhere near that level of

maturity when I was their age so I mean

I think this is the the plus side of

like YouTube influencer culture right if

you think back to J X yeah for example

like before us you know the sort of

slacker culture in part because there

was no like obvious place to let out

what might be a natural ambition now

like every kid is like I'm going to be

like a very successful YouTuber all

right they're not going to be yeah but

at least they're thinking in terms of uh

like an ambition like okay I could do

this I could focus on this i' have to

buy a camera and then if I got really

good we could grow the audience like a

lot of people don't think that way

totally when they're 15 16 years old

absolutely now the key is how do you

take that ambition and then translate it

away from I'm going to be a twitch

streamer yeah like you know what like

that same mindset you could push over

here to like the sport you're training

for or like you're getting into the

theater as like a high school student

like you could put that same ambition

over here and realizing oh this is this

is something I can do for like whatever

I'm interested one thing that I've been

thinking about a lot lately is that our

generation Gen X and before starting

with the Boomers really

self-destructiveness kind of became cool

became a status symbol I think it

started in the 60s with the free love

and rock and roll and everything and it

continued up through the 90s and I feel

like Jin Z is the first generation since

maybe the 40s and 50s that status is

awarded towards constructive Behavior

sure which it's actually kind of blowing

my mind like I it's one of those when

you're it's like a fish doesn't

recognize the water that it's been

swimming in its whole life I've become a

lot more aware of a lot of the

destructive tendencies that existed when

I was a teenager and in my 20s and a lot

of the dumb destructive [ __ ] I did

because I thought it was cool and it got

it got like won me cool points with my

friends it's something that's just

really been sitting on my mind quite a

bit lately and I I don't totally know

how to explain it or what to make of it

I mean it's it's a good question like

what to what for example this whole

phenomenon of interaction is more

digital for the for jiny right there's

some real harms about that it also is

reducing self-destructive Behavior

because now you I have other ways that I

I I can at least simulate sociality when

it's when I'm just with my buddies yeah

when we were in our teens right you like

do stupid stuff like I don't know this

is the group I'm stuck with yes like how

are we going to what's going to impress

them like okay I think I can you know

you take the car to the parking lot

we're going to do the donuts and what we

literally would do this steal steal your

m beer yeah yeah we now kids are like

let's you know let's let's uh let's

record a let's play of this like new

video game so but then there's also C so

it's interesting it's it's Evolution um

our generation also had I wrote this New

Yorker piece about this last year my

take on our generation like at least

from our relationship to work is that we

were the first generation raised on

follow your passion yes right so abut

that is an idea that Rose in the 1990s

right we can just look at it enic

ethologically um that got big in the

'90s so Gen X didn't have that as much

then we're also the generation that got

911 in the financial crisis so like we

learned we like wait a second this

doesn't work this idea and so like f

your passion was the Baby Boomers trying

to rationalize these two sides of their

experience the 60s and 70s in which it

was like you need to like be true to

yourself and then the 80s and early 90s

were like oh you need money to pay

mortgages and there's a lot of you know

so how do we and they're like what if we

just put these two things together we'll

we'll like take all the good and get rid

of all the bad from our life and like

make money but be passionate about

working at the law firm or whatever and

then we figured out that doesn't work

like it's not how you job satisfaction

doesn't come from matching the content

of your job to a pre-existing passion so

our generation invented job engineering

like we you know we we get like the

minimalism Movement we get lifestyle

design we get uh all these Instagram

influencers they're showing alternative

like that's what our generation came

away with is like okay you got to shape

your life like that really influences us

it's a lot in my book How do you craft

your life to be what you want and it's

very pragmatic we get like the fire

movement like this is all Gen Y

Millennial like oh Follow Your Passion

didn't work so we got to just sort of

re-engineer work to be what we need out

of it so like now Jin Z is doing its own

thing so this is last question I want to

ask you the three principles of slow

productivity it occurred to me that this

is actually kind of a an umbrella

framework for all of your books so if

you look at do fewer things is digital

minimalism work at your own pace deep

work and then obsess over quality is so

good they can't ignore you did you think

of it in those terms or did that just

kind of naturally emerge it's somewhat

purposeful okay yeah right right so so

it's trying to draw all these ideas I've

been exploring deconstruct them

understand them and then rebuild like a

coherent Philosophy for work yeah so it

is I think it's why people who like my

prior books who have read this are like

oh yeah no I really like this if they

were if they like the prior books

they're going to really like it I'm

actually writing an article right now um

maybe it'll be out in this podcast there

it's a New Yorker piece it's a personal

essay right so uh I've been writing a

lot about this book but they're like why

don't we write something different let's

do something different let's do

something personal and so I excavated my

past right and in this essay I go back

to my time in the theory group at MIT

this it and it was like this

Preposterous place like this is because

I I had put a lot of this down but I

came back I reded this up like what it

was like showing up at the theory group

at MIT which is the number one Theory

group in the world right and it was

Preposterous I I come to orientation and

one of the first people I meet 16

starting the doctoral program graduated

college two years earlier so he

graduated college at 14 had spent two

years all right show up the uh the

professor across from me like in their

office is uh my age and he wanted

MacArthur the year before was hired as a

professor when he was 20 got tenure at

the end of my first year and he was the

least accomplished person on that wall

of offices three offices had tur Award

winners and he was the there's and F

anyway so I went back and like reded

this like Preposterous experience and

basically the point of this essay is

like oh my God everything I've chased in

all these books that culminate in slow

productivity all of it goes back to my

time at the theory group they were

obsessed over Focus they had a real sort

of humanistic because they were

theoreticians computer science

theoreticians in a world of Engineers

the human mind is what matters be very

wary of technology and like how it

affects the mind there was no rushing

theoreticians can't rush rush so they

were very productive but like they

didn't you couldn't be busy because you

can't force proofs so I realize all

these things like uh work at a natural

pace on not too many things care a lot

about Focus be obsessed about quality

everything I've done I realized it's

like this fiveyear experience of this

like Preposterous place that no business

being there um I've just been chasing it

ever since so that's that's my new self

therapy is like that experience is

something I've been trying to like

grapple with in my writing for 20 years

later one of my favorite quotes I don't

remember who said it we spend our entire

lives trying to either prove or disprove

who we were at 18 yeah it was so

overwhelming this experience that I've

never I was like okay I just have to

Grapple with this for the rest of my

life like I think I think there's

something happening here in a weird

extreme purified form that is in somehow

right yeah and it's being lost in this

like really weird Preposterous place

that no one sees but I think they've

like ABS accidentally like purified and

made radical like these ideas like why

have they stuck with I think they were

on to something and then I just keep

rediscovering them again and again nice

all right that's all for the show be

sure to follow the show if you haven't

leave a review make sure you're

subscribed and tell me how handsome I am

and we'll be back next week with an all

new episode of the subtle art of not giv

a [ __ ] podcast see you all then
