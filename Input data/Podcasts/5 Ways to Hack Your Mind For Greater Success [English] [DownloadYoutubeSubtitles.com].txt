- Drew, I wanna be successful.

I'm really trying to get,

to get it together over here.

- You need to get it together, yeah.

- I, just things have
not been falling my way

for the past 12 years at all.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

- You know, the internet is full of

a lot of hokey pieces of content

talking about life hacks and
mind hacks and success hacks.

And you know, most of them involve

some configuration of alarm
clocks and ice and bathtubs

- Mm-hmm
- And,

yeah, they didn't really work for me.

So let's actually talk about

what the psychological research shows

can completely hack your brain

towards being more
oriented towards success.

So we've got five topics here

and I want you to walk me through these,

and explain how I'm finally
gonna be successful enough

that my mom is proud of me.

- Okay, I'm teaching you today, okay.

All right, let's do this.

- This wasn't on the job description

when you applied.
- This was not.

This was not.

- I need a researcher, podcast producer,

and life coach.
- And a life coach.

- [Narrator] The podcast
that's saving the world

one fewer fuck at a time.

It's The Subtle Art of
Not Giving a Fuck podcast

with your host, Mark Manson.

- Find the pain you enjoy.

- [Drew] Hmm.

- We all have a little
bit of masochism in us.

There's like a certain
area of our lives that

become masochistic to a certain degree.

And I personally think that

that's probably the area of our life that

we're gonna end up

having an advantage in.
- Mm-hmm.

- Another way to think
about it is just like

what is the bowl of shit
that you don't mind eating

that most people do?

And a lot of this is,
it's personality based,

like you don't teach yourself

to like a bowl of shit that
you don't actually like.

Like there are gonna be some things

that you just naturally enjoy
doing or don't mind doing

that most people fucking hate doing,

or it stresses them out,
or it freaks them out,

or it scares the shit out of them.

Find those things

because that's gonna be
your competitive advantage.

It's almost like, I think,

when thinking about skills or talent,

people again tend to focus
almost entirely on the positive.

Like, what am I good at

that other people maybe aren't as good?

Even if you're good at something,

there's gonna be a lot of other
people who are good at it,

but it's like,

what can you stomach that
most other people can't?

- Mm-hmm.
- Like, what's the bullshit

that you kind of secretly enjoy

that you get like a satisfaction out of

that most people don't.

And that's probably the secret sauce.

- Yeah.
- You know?

And I think in my case, it's two things.

One is just I think the self-consciousness

or the anxiety and self-doubt

that comes with writing
or creating in general,

I enjoy it to a certain extent.

Like, I just, I really
love the creative process,

the actual process itself,

like not just like
fantasizing about ideas,

but like actually making the
thing and seeing how bad it is,

and then trying to make it better,

and seeing how bad that is

and then trying to make it better,

like that really enliven me.

And then I think the other thing

I think I'm just built for is,

I don't know, I don't really
mind the haters in the feed,

like the bullshit, you know,
- Yeah.

Yeah, you're good at that.
- that come at me.

Like, I don't-
- You don't let it bother you.

I mean, it affects you,

but you don't let it
- Yeah.

- bother you, I think.

Yeah
- Yeah.

It'll like ruin my lunch,
but that's about it.

- And then you're over by lunch,

whereas me, I'm still thinking about

like that thing I fucked
up 10 years ago, like.

So yeah, I totally get it.

- That's what's keeping you up at night.

- That's what's keeping me up at night.

No, for real.

Yeah, yeah.

No, I get that.

I think for me, I like the,

I think I'd call it like
that, the pain of learning.

- Yeah.
- For whatever reason,

I've always just like, I've just,

that's just one of my kind of
core values is like learning.

And there's a lot of like discomfort

that comes with that too.
- Mm-hmm.

- You know, that's what
got me through school.

I don't think I was ever
actually the smartest person.

I was just like, always like, so like,

I had to figure this out.
- Mm-hmm.

- You know, I had to, I like
to sit down and figure it out.

- Do you think your tolerance for boredom

is higher than most?

- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

I believe that knowing the academic papers

I've sent to you to have you read

- Mm-hmm
- instead of me,

I believe that.

- Yeah, oh, God.

If you get a good one of those, man, yeah.

It took hell, yeah.

- It's fucking rough, dude.

- Somebody called it,
I like, what somebody,

I heard this years ago,

they call it ass power.

- Ass power?
- You have those, yeah.

So you can sit your ass in a chair

- Yeah.
- and like work through

just figuring shit out.
- Yeah.

- And whether that's
like an academic paper

or like some new software
or something like that,

I love figuring out like a new program.

Like just get in there.
- Oh.

- And like there's people
who just hate that.

- Yeah.
- Or like spreadsheets.

I get this is,

oh my God, this is,
- Oh, yeah.

I'm with you there.

- I love that kind of stuff.

There was this story I
heard years ago about this.

It was the state patrol.

I went to a talk for the state patrol

and they had a K-9 unit there.

- Okay.
- And they were talking about

how they train and select
dogs and everything like that.

So what they do is

they'll go out to a field,
- Mm-hmm.

- and it's like full of just brush and,

you know, bushes and whatever.

And they take their favorite toy

and they'll throw it out
there and it's hidden, buried.

They don't show them where
it is or anything like that.

And they turn them loose.

And they don't select the dogs

that necessarily find it the fastest.

They select the dogs that don't quit.

- Hmm.

- Which I thought was really interesting.

And when I heard that,

I was like, yeah,
- That's-

- I'm not the fastest or smartest dog.

I'm the one who won't quit
until I find the ball.

- That's so interesting.
- Yeah, I love that story.

So, yeah.

Yeah, that's-
- How there's like,

there's so many areas of life

that applies to.
- That are like that.

Absolutely, absolutely.

Whatever that is,

that seeking or that I
got to figure this out,

I know there's an answer to this,

- Yeah.
- and I have to figure it out.

Especially when I know there's
an answer to something,

I'm like, I know this is figureoutable.

- Yeah.
- I can do it.

It'd like, that sets me off.

- I feel like sometimes
my advantage is just,

it's not even,

like I think people think
that I don't give a fuck of

what other people think,
- Mm-hmm.

- whereas it's more
accurate to just say that

I'm oblivious to what other people think.

Like, I'm just so

in my own little world.
- 100%.

- Like I remember I was in high school

and I'm like I'm super unathletic

and I went to a small school that

because there were so few kids,

we all had to

sign up for a sport.
- Everybody did, yeah.

- So I signed up for cross-country,

'cause the only alternative was football

and I didn't wanna get
shit knocked out of me.

So I signed up for cross-country,

even though I was a terrible runner.

And I was so fat and
slow and out of shape.

I was the worst runner on
the team by a large margin.

And I remember we went out for
the first cross-country meet,

and I think it was like four
or five miles or something.

I had never run that far in my life.

So we start to race, everybody
runs out in front of me.

I'm just like trotting along.

I get maybe like two miles in,

and I'm exhausted, I just start walking.

And I'm walking and I'm walking.

I'm by myself for like 30, 40 minutes.

- Mm-hmm.

- The race that started after us begins

and those kids start passing me.

And I'm just like,

at this point I'm like
way off in the woods

by myself, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

- And I'm still walking.

And like, I remember all these like,

high school girls are running
past me and they're like,

don't give up, keep going.

And I was like, go fuck yourself.

And I just keep walking
and walking and walking.

And like, finally I get to the finish line

after the next race had finished.

And it's literally just
my dad and my coach there.

- Yeah.

- And I'm like, this sucks.

I wanna go home, whatever.

And so I go to school the next week

and we used to have
these like announcements

and they kind of announce like
the sports from that weekend.

And my coach gets up and he announces,

first of all, nobody on my school's team

placed or won anything,

and like everybody knew that.
- Yeah.

- And, but then the
cross-country coach gets up

in front of like the whole school.

It was like a hundred
people, the whole school.

And he's like, I wanna
give out an award today.

And I'm like, oh, maybe
somebody did finish.

And he's like, he calls
my name Mark Manson.

Everybody starts clapping.

And I'm like, are you like,

I thought he was trolling me.

I thought he was like
trying to embarrass me.

And he told me it was,

he said it was the most
inspirational thing

that he had ever seen.
- What?

- Because he said that
half of the team quit

after like two miles.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

- And like nobody placed.
- Yeah.

- And like, it was just this

horrendous and embarrassing showing

and I walked the entire route

and I let all the next race pass me and,

but the funny thing is

he was like telling me
how inspirational it was.

And I remember I was sitting there like,

I went up and got like this
like trophy or something.

I remember thinking, I was like,

it never occurred to me to even quit.

Like, I never even.
- Yeah, yeah.

- It didn't even, I was
just like, whatever,

okay, this race goes by, whatever.

Like, anyway it's.

Obliviousness can be an advantage.

- Yeah, no, for sure.

For sure.

Focus on what you can control

and ignore what you can't.

I think this one, to use your phrase,

people give too many fucks
about the wrong things,

I think.
- Right.

- And a lot of times what that is is that

we're trying to control
things we just can't control.

- Yeah.
- Right?

People's feelings, people's actions,

other people just in general.
- Right.

- I think we try to do that a lot.

Those are kind of obvious ones for

if you're aging, you're
getting older, stuff like that.

People worry about that kind of thing.

Worrying about the past,

you know, all these
ones are pretty common.

I would say though,
too, like your emotions,

you can't really control your emotions,

though you can control

your reaction to your emotions, right?

- I hate that term.
- Okay.

- Control your emotions.
- Yeah, yeah.

- I think it is a complete misnomer

and I think it really leads people astray.

- Yeah.
- I could not tell you

how many emails I've gotten
over the years of people saying,

how do I control my emotions?

And I'm like, you can't.
- Mm-hmm.

- That it's the animal part of you.

It just happens.

And what you have to do is

take like the smart human part of you

and tame the animal
part of you and be like,

don't shit on the carpet,
bad dog, go to your room.

I mean, that is essentially
just what self-discipline is.

- Yeah, yeah.
- In a nutshell,

is kind of like the higher
order your neocortex

like training and subduing
your more animalistic side.

But yeah, I mean, this is the
classic stoic thing, right?

Focus on what you can control,

be at peace with what you can't.

And I would throw in there

most things you can't control.
- Right.

- So beware of obsessing too much

or getting too caught up in all the things

that are going on outside of you that,

that can simply be distracting
or draining on you.

The emotional piece is super important.

You can't control the emotion,

but you can control the
response to the emotion.

You can't control other people,

but you can control your
response to other people, right?

Like, I can't control if
a friend is an asshole,

but I can control

how I confront him.
- Mm-hmm.

- I can control the
conversation I have with him

around his behavior.

I can control whether I hang
out with him again or not.

I hate to bring this
back to responsibility.

It feels like we always fucking bring

everything back to responsibility.

But like that's

where the responsibility
piece comes in of like

by focusing on what you can control,

you are then forced to take responsibility

for the things you can control,

because once you recognize

the things you can control and change,

then the only excuse for not changing is

that you didn't do anything.

- Yeah, yeah.

I've noticed a lot lately
since I've, you know,

I've talked about my sleep problems a lot.

And a lot of times if I wake
up in the middle of the night

and I can't go back to sleep,

my mind starts to turn.
- Mm-hmm.

- And a lot of emotions start
coming up during that too.

And it's usually like,

I'm worrying about something

and getting like real fatalistic about it.

And it's like, kind of,

it's pretty intense
emotions sometimes too.

I've really trained myself to be like,

ah, this will pass.
- Yeah.

- This too shall pass.

And that's the reaction
I've chosen with that

that's helped me a lot.

And I go back to sleep
a little bit better.

That's been part of my
sleep journey this year too.

- Yup.

- Just doing that whole reframe like,

oh, this is a temporary thing.

It's like, tomorrow is
not necessarily gonna suck

when I wake up or

my life is not gonna
get any worse actually.

- Yeah.
- This will pass,

I'm gonna let that go.

- You know, it's funny you bring that up.

Like, one of the best thing, you know,

as we've talked about before,

my wife Fernanda,
- Mm-hmm.

- she's struggled with
sleep her whole life.

One of the biggest things for her was

when she started meditating.

And what she realized, it
was really interesting,

because I think a lot of
people who struggle with sleep,

part of it is that they fall into that

doom loop of like,
- Mm-hmm.

- you know, maybe you lay down,

you put your head on the pillow,

your mind starts worrying about something,

and then you realize your mind
is worrying about something

and you're like, oh, God,

I'm worrying about something,
I'm never gonna sleep.

And then you're like,
- Yes, yes.

- then that kicks the loop in the gear

and you're like, well, now I'm
worrying that I'm worrying.

Oh, God, now I'm worried about everything

and now I'm never gonna sleep.
- Mm-hmm.

- And it becomes this kind
of self-fulfilling prophecy.

And you know, she's not a huge meditator,

but one of the most effective
things that she found was,

was simply meditating for
10 or 15 minutes before bed

because it helped her.

You know, if she put
her head on the pillow,

that worrying thought came up,

it allowed her to just let that thought go

- [Drew] Mm-hmm.

- and not get caught in that loop.

And just by simply by not
getting caught up in that loop,

it like made everything
else flow much easier.

- Yeah, so those are things
you can't control necessarily.

I think there's a few things
that people can control

that they don't though too.
- Okay.

- Things like boundaries.

- Yeah.
- That sort of thing.

What you consume,
- Mm-hmm.

- like media consumption.

I think people get caught up in, you know,

news cycles or whatever
it is and they're like,

well, I can't control
- Yes.

- all these crazy things
going on in the world.

Yeah, you're right you can't,

but you can control

what you consume.
- Yeah.

- and what you pay attention to.

- Can I just go on a tangent here?

- Oh, please.

I'll allow it.

So I have this weird thing,
- Yeah?

- where bad TV shows,
- Mm-hmm.

- I know all the platforms have analytics

and they're measuring watch time

and they're basing
their production budgets

on watch time of previous shows.

So if I start watching a
Netflix show and it's bad,

I turn it off as soon as I possibly can

because you don't wanna
reward bad content, right?

It kills me when people I know are like,

yeah, that show was terrible.

And I'm like, yeah, I turned
it off in episode one.

And they're like, I
finished the whole season.

I'm like, stop doing that.

You're promoting bad behavior.

I'm like this particularly
salient for me right now

because "3 Body Problem" came out recently

and it's one of my favorite sci-fi books,

favorite fiction series ever.

And the show was complete garbage.

And everybody I know
watched the whole thing

and didn't like it.

And I'm like,

they're gonna make more.
- Yeah.

- This is why we don't have nice things.

So anyway, don't finish bad Netflix shows.

Carry on.

- There is a larger
conversation under that though.

Like the personal responsibility

around your media consumption.

If you don't like the landscape,

change your own behavior.
- Yes.

- And that does have an impact.

I know it's small and whatever,

and it's on the individual level,

but it does have an impact.

And I think we all have a
responsibility around that.

And again, that's paying attention

to what you can't control.

The biggest thing you can't
control is your attention.

- Yeah, in today's media environment,

I mean, I joke about the Netflix thing,

but in seriousness,

like the social media algorithms that

the news companies rely upon,
- Mm-hmm.

- they notice your engagement, right?

- Mm-hmm.
- So it's like,

block them, stop following
them, stop reading them,

stop clicking on articles,

stop watching videos of
people you don't respect

or you don't like,

because that simply reinforces
to all the algorithms that,

hey, we should show this to more people.

I feel like everybody should
understand that in 2024,

but sometimes it seems like people don't.

Like if you hate something,

the best thing you can do is block it

and not engage with it.
- Right.

I got another one for you.

This is an example that a lot of people

I think they don't have
control over, but they do,

- Mm-hmm.
- which is who you love.

I think that's more of a
choice than most people think.

I think it's actually
almost entirely a choice.

There's that whole like
kind of a cliche like,

oh, you can't help who you love,

you can't help who you like.

And actually I think

there's a lot more control
over that than we think.

And I first came across this idea actually

in Derek Sivers' book "How To Live."

- Mm-hmm.
- And he had this

whole section on you can choose to love

anybody who's around you.

That is a choice you can make.
- Yeah.

- In a relationship, it is.

It's a constant choice
you make on who to love.

But it's also just like

if someone's around you,
you don't even like them.

I think you could actually
choose to like them eventually,

- Yeah.
- and love them.

'Cause there's that emotional side

that we've already talked
about you can't control.

- Yeah.
- But I think

there's a deeper type of love

that you can control that you choose.

- I think you can choose to empathize.

- Okay.

- And I think you can choose

to take on the perspective
of somebody completely openly

and nonjudgmentally.
- Mm-hmm.

- If you do that in a very
radical and compassionate way,

is that the same thing as love?

I don't know like,
- Mm-hmm.

- as you know, the definition of love

is super murky,
- Right.

- especially in the English language.

But I agree with you that your
disposition towards somebody

is largely within your control.

And I would even say, so to your point,

those unconscious emotions that emerge,

you know, if you go on
a date with somebody

and you just like find
yourself completely infatuated

and kind of head over heels with them,

a lot of that is because
they're reflecting back to you

certain values and characteristics

that you have chosen
- Mm-hmm.

- to seek and prioritize.

I look back at this like,

I think back to

some of the women that I
dated when I was younger

and it really did not go well.

And I can see that part of the
reason it didn't go well is

because I was prioritizing
the wrong things

in a partner that I look for.

I, like most young, immature people,

I prioritize

really superficial things.
- Yeah, yeah.

- And that gets you in the trouble.

And I think as you get older,

you realize that you should
deprioritize those things

and prioritize other, you know,

deeper, more intimate things.

And then that will be reflected
in the emotions that emerge

around the right person so.
- Okay, okay.

- That's a very long-winded way of saying

you're right, Drew.

How wise.
- In some way, yeah.

- How wise.
- Yeah, yeah.

Okay so yeah, how does this make you,

how does only focusing
on what you can control

make you more successful?

- I think part of this is

it's almost like the essence
of productivity of like

expending your time and energy on things

that will generate

positive change for you.
- Mm-hmm.

- If you're expending most
of your time and energy on

reacting to bullshit that's
outside of your control,

then by definition that is

a waste of time and energy, right?

So I think it's almost like
the crux of productivity is

this ability to focus on
what's within your control

and then what's also like

the highest leverage
thing within your control.

But some of it too is
just like freeing up that

mental and emotional space.
- Mm-hmm.

- Like not getting bogged
down in distraction,

not getting bogged down in outrage

and emotional overreacting

and drama with people that

ultimately you kind of
don't really care about.

It's almost like it frees up your energy

to be directed in the most
efficient direction possible.

- Yeah, for sure, yeah.

I think too, there's the
concept of locus of control

in psychology.
- Yeah.

- You have an internal locus of control

where these are the things I can control

and you look for the
things you can control

versus external locus of control,

these things are happening to me,

I have no control of it.
- Mm-hmm.

- This trains you to kind of

find the things you do
control in your environment

- Yeah.
- and can have an impact on.

And like you just said,
be more efficient with it.

- Yeah.

- And can generalize to
other areas of your life.

- It always blew me away how
much internal locus of control

just like maps onto almost

every positive life outcome.
- Yeah, yeah.

- In the research like,

it's just happier, more
successful, more productive,

better relationships,

like boom, boom, boom, boom.

You can go down the entire list

and it's generally
internal locus of control.

So that's what we're here to do.

- Yeah, yeah.
- Teach people

internal locus of control.

what are you waiting for?

So what's the next one?

- The next one, turn off the autopilot.

- Hmm.

- I need some help with this one, Mark.

- What's your autopilot?

- I'm very much a creature of habit.

- Yeah.

- And if they're healthy habit,

sure, that's fine.
- Mm-hmm.

- But I just notice any
change in my environment.

I don't like it, like, you know,

coming out here to LA and stuff like,

oh, I don't have my gym

and I don't have my,
you know, my whatever,

my little coffee shop that I like.

- Oh, no.
- All that kind of stuff.

And I definitely get into those routines

and I feel those kind of

safe, comfortable areas of my life that

I really like to retreat to.
- Yeah.

- I feel like, I don't know,

I just feel like

you're way more open to
experience than I am.

You know, way more, but quite a bit more.

- Sure.
- And you see,

you're more adaptable with it.

I mean, that's kind of a
personality thing, I think.

But I don't know.

I think there's also something
to being able to just be

a little bit more spontaneous
than I am sometimes.

- I personally feel like
a certain amount of chaos

- Mm-hmm.
- is probably optimal.

There's a great, like one
of my favorite movies is

Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight."

And there's a scene with the Joker

where he is talking to Harvey Dent

and he says, inject a little
bit of chaos into your life.

And I always love that line because it's,

I do feel like a modest
amount of chaos is probably

more optimal than zero chaos.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

- Because it's,

I think a certain amount of
unpredictability and spontaneity

can ignite a lot of
insight, a lot of growth,

a lot of excitement and
meaning and purpose.

And I don't know,

it just makes life a lot more interesting.

I also think you can kind of

intentionally inject that chaos yourself.

Like you don't have to do
something crazy and destructive.

I think we can find unpredictability or

disrupt that routine or that autopilot

in a way that's effective.

Like I met, I was at a
dinner recently and I met

a professional MMA fighter,

and she was saying that

once a year she gives herself
a goal that feels impossible,

a physical goal

that feels impossible.
- Mm-hmm.

- And then she goes and does it.

- Yeah.

- And so last year she climbed Everest

with zero mountain training.

I was like, okay, I'm
never gonna fuck with you.

- No, shit.

Not that you were before,

but you really are now, yeah.
- Yeah, but like,

she was kind of like,

she was like kind of
telling the table this

as like an inspiration.

She's like, yeah, I just
always find it like one year,

you know, she went,
she like spontaneously,

she like walked like

a hundred miles or something.
- Mm-hmm.

- And didn't stop till she finished.

And you know, everybody's
like, oh, that's cool.

And then they were like,
what'd you do this year?

And she was like, oh, I climbed Everest.

And they're like, do you climb mountains?

She's like, no.

- Geez.

Oh, my God.

- I was like, okay.

I'm gonna dial it back a little bit.

- Yeah, yeah.
- But,

I like that concept of
pick something that is

like almost irrationally difficult

and just see if you can do it.

Will Smith used to have this thing

that he used to say to me,
he said that he was like,

I used to try to bite
off more than I can chew,

and then I'd figure out

how to chew it afterwards.
- Mm-hmm.

- And he was very aware that we tend to

our assumption of our own
capacity is generally as a rule

always below our actual capacity.

And so he would intentionally
set himself up to do things,

do more things than he
thought he was capable of.

So like, I remember he
told me, he was like,

yeah, when I started doing movies,

I went to my manager and I was like,

we're gonna do an album.

And the manager's like, whoa,

our schedule's booked the next
two years, there's no time.

He's like, no, we're gonna do an album

while I'm doing the movies.

And his team was like, that's impossible.

- Right.
- And he's like,

we're gonna figure it out.

And he fucking did, right?

So it's, you intentionally set
those kind of impossible bars

and then your brain starts setting

to inventing and innovating
new ways to find them.

Also, when I was thinking about this,

I couldn't help but think
about that Seinfeld episode.

Did you ever see the episode

where George Costanza does
like the opposite date?

- Oh, yeah.

That's a great episode.
- Oh, my God.

It's like one of the
best Seinfeld episodes,

- That is, yeah.
- So for listeners

who haven't watched Seinfeld,
- That's so good.

there's a character George Costanza,

he's kind of like

Jerry Seinfeld's best friend in the show.

And he's just kind of a loser.

Like everything he does, he's just a mess.

He's always screwing things up.

He's single.

He's blowing dates.

Like his family, his
parents are assholes to him.

He's just a classic loser.

And then there's,
- There's a lot of

dark psychology in there too, yeah.

- And then there's one episode

where he gets so fed up with
his own life that he's like,

I'm just gonna do the
opposite of everything

I would normally do.
- Right.

- And so like, he goes into work,

and he starts cursing out his boss

and telling of his boss how stupid he is.

And his boss is like, wow, I
really needed to hear that.

You know what, you're due for a raise.

And then like, he goes
on a date and he's like

saying all the opposite
stuff that he normally says.

And just like gorgeous woman
is like completely falls

in love with him.
- Yeah, he's like.

I don't have a job, I live with my mom.

I'm bald, I'm short.
- Yeah.

- And she's like, hey.

- She's like, wow, you're
so honest, that's so sexy.

- [Drew] Yeah, yeah.

- So it's the Costanza theorem
- Yeah.

- of like, if you feel stuck
in an area in your life,

try the opposite,

- Yeah.
- see what happens.

- And it sounds so simple.

'Cause it's like, yeah, you're in a rut,

so just do something different, right?

- Yeah.
- But we don't think of that.

- Yeah.
- We don't,

we get so comfortable even in the ruts,

you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

It's, I don't know what that is,

and I'm very much like I said,

a creature of habit because
of that I think too.

It's just you get your
comfortable spaces and whatever.

- Yeah.
- But, yeah.

I don't know.

- Yeah, well, I like this because it,

I mean, aside from pushing comfort zones,

- Mm-hmm.
- it helps us redefine

what we consider possible
and impossible, right?

Like if we usually kiss up to our boss,

maybe being bluntly honest
and borderline offensive.

- Yeah.

- You'd be shocked at what's possible.

Maybe that actually does go better, right?

Or, you know, putting
work goals on your plate

that feel impossible today.

Turns out actually it's like

you have more capacity
than you thought you did.

- Right, yeah.

- Speaking of which, the next one,

it's adopt a 10x mindset.

What is a 10x mindset?

- The basics of it though is that

we all kind of just limit ourselves.

We think too small and it makes sense

because if you wanna do anything big,

you have to think big, right?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

- I think you're really good at this too.

Another area you could impart

some wisdom onto me I think here.

But we do, we limit ourselves.

You know, you've several
times on the podcast

told the allegory about the elephant.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- Who gets tied to the fence post

and doesn't realize he
can break away from it.

That sort of thing definitely
happens a lot I think.

And we just, we set very small goals.

- Yeah.
- And then

I think some of us wonder
why we don't have more.

And I don't know.

What's the key to thinking
bigger do you think?

You have a very good
sense of the big picture

I think a lot of times.
- Yeah.

- And you tend to aim high, shoot high.

And you know, you fail
sometimes with it but.

- Most of the time.
- What's your secret, Mark?

- What's my secret?

I, first of all, I like zooming out.

- Mm-hmm.

- I like the big picture that's just like

my brain kind of goes
that direction naturally.

I like asking myself.

What does this look like
three years from now?

What does this look like
five years from now?

And I think that's an
important tendency to develop

because I think it's so easy to get,

everybody tends to get caught up

in like the immediate future.

Everybody's worried about
next month or next quarter,

- [Drew] Right.

- or next year.

And I like to ask myself like,

if I did what I'm doing this
month for the next 10 years,

where am I gonna end up?
- Mm-hmm.

- And okay, how do I optimize for that?

So I think part of it is timescale,

zooming out and looking at timescale.

'Cause a lot of what, you know,

the 10x rule, one way to
think about it is it's

to get the 10x of anything,

you're gonna have to
compound your way there,

and compounding requires time.
- Mm-hmm.

- So like, what's the
best way to leverage time

the next five to 10 years?

So that's one element of it.

I think the second
element of it is just like

big goals are more exciting.

They're sexier.

They feel, I mean,

obviously if you manage
to accomplish them,

they feel better.

And then I also, to come back
to the Will Smith point like,

we tend to underestimate

what our actual capacity is.
- Mm-hmm.

- So if you are overshooting

what you perceive your capacity to be,

you're actually probably gonna end up

much closer to your real capacity.

So you're actually maximizing
your brain quite a bit more.

And then of course there's
like that old cliche,

which is shoot for the stars,

and even if you miss, you'll
land on the moon, Drew.

- I think it's the other way around.

Shoot for the moon

and if you miss you'll
land among the stars.

- 'Cause the stars are further.

- Okay.

- I just-
- Yeah, yeah.

I see what you're saying,
I see what you're saying.

- I have qualms with this Instagram,

- Okay.
- this inspirational

Instagram quote.

I'll take it up with somebody else though.

- Right.

- But yeah, I think it's,

I think it's a combination
of a lot of those things.

- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

I think, yeah, you hear about this a lot,

like in money and business
and stuff like that like.

And I think there's some
business gurus out there,

or even like Ramit Sethi
talks about this a lot where,

you know, you can,

this is kind if a variation
on the 10x rule I think,

you can cut your expenses to zero, right?

- Yeah.
- You could do that.

You could cut your expenses
all the way to zero,

but that's the limit on that.

On the other side of it though,

there's no limit to

how much you can make.
- Mm-hmm.

- So there's like a switch in
thinking there too over like

what to 10x or what to optimize for.

But I think you could apply
that to other areas as well

not just like money and
business and stuff like that.

I think you could apply it to,

I'll go back to the
relationships thing again.

You can cut out the problems
in your relationship

and as much as you can,
- Mm-hmm.

- as much as it practical, right?

But is there a limit on how
deep your connection can go?

Is there a limit on the number of things

you can learn about your partner?

Stuff like that.

Like, to me that's like going from like a

oh, let's make our relationship
a little bit better

to let's make this a lot better.

- Yeah.
- And you,

and you're changing
what you're focusing on

rather than changing on the
little problems you can cut out,

you're changing more the focus to

how can we connect on these things?

How can I learn more about you?

- 10x in a relationship.
- Yeah.

That was a thought experiment

I went through with this, anyway.

- I'm like wondering what
that would look like.

I always get wary around relationships

because you run into
- Mm-hmm.

- a lot of backwards law stuff
- Mm-hmm.

- of like, trying to
optimize a relationship,

- Oh, yeah.
- ends up becoming

the relationship problem.

Whereas if you just stop
trying to optimize it,

it would be how happier.
- I see, okay.

- It's funny I've run into
a couple friends recently

who are in new relationships

and they've gotten really excited

'cause they've set up
like Notion dashboards

to track KPIs and stuff.

And I'm like, stop, fucking stop.

Like, just don't do it.

Don't go down that road.

I understand the motivation
and the desire but.

I will say this, like it's to me the,

you know, ultimately the principle of

the 10x rule or whatever
- Mm-hmm.

- is that there's a degree
of success available to you

that is much larger than
you're currently conceiving of.

And in the relationship realm,

the way I've experienced that is

an incredible amount
of comfort and security

with the same person.
- Mm-hmm.

- Which is ironic because
you can't force that.

It's actually the lack of
forcing that gives you that.

Like it's the, after 12 years together,

my wife and I, we have such a
like insane level of comfort

and ease around each other.
- Mm-hmm.

That you can't achieve that,

you can't shortcut it
and you can't achieve it

in any other way.

And if you tried to shortcut it

or achieve it in another way,

you would be removing
the comfort and ease.

And so you'd be like,
it'd be self-defeating.

So, anyway.
- Okay.

- It's a little bit of a tangent but.

- No, I think you make a good point.

It's probably,

which is don't necessarily
apply business principles

to your relationships.

- Which there are.
- Jesus.

Tell me you're an
American by not telling me

you're American, right?
- Which Drew,

I was just gonna say,
judging by my friend group,

a lot of people need to hear that.

It's so funny, dude.

Like a lot of,

you know, we don't have kids.
- Mm-hmm.

- So a lot of our friends out here in LA,

like a lot of the new
friends that we've made

are five, 10 years

younger than us.
- Yes.

- And so a lot of it is,

it's kind of like a lot of our friends,

our couple friends out
here are couples who are

likely to get married,
- Mm-hmm.

- you know, but either aren't married

or they just got married,

but they haven't had kids yet.

But they're all, you know,

two, three, four, five
years into the relationship.

And we're kind of like

the elder couple now, right?
- Right, yeah.

- So like, we're over 40

and we've been together
for longer than everybody.

And so we've actually
had a number of couples

who have kind of come to us and like

peppered us with questions.

And it's like every single time

Fernanda and I are just like,

yeah, maybe just don't try so hard like.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Just like,

just enjoy being together.

- And you know, a lot of business people.

- So you're saying

a lot of them are like trying
- Totally, totally.

- to run it like a business.
- Totally.

- Yeah, okay, okay.
- Yeah, exactly, exactly.

- All right, well,, yeah,

I'll not do that from now on.

- This episode is brought
to you by Marek Health.

Staying healthy isn't
just about hitting the gym

and devouring pounds of kale.

That's why I turned to Marek Health

to take my health to the next level.

Marek Health is like a superhero sidekick

you didn't know you need
or at least I didn't.

Or actually, you know what,
fuck the sidekick part,

it's more like a health Batman.

It shows you things

that you didn't know you
needed in the first place.

Forget the basic checkups

where the doc barely looks at your results

unless you're practically dead.

Marek Health's telehealth service
is all about optimization.

They tested me for stuff that
I didn't even know existed

and came up with a list of
personalized recommendations

that was about 20 pages long,

specifically catered to
my body, my genetics,

and my situation.

They're a huge part of why

I'm in the best shape of
my life at 40 years old.

So if you're ready to level up,

sign up for Marek's optimization package

for a topnotch lab
assessment, in-depth reports,

video chats with specialists,

and a super easy setup.

Head over to marekhealth.com/IDGAF

or use the promo code IDGAF at checkout.

It stands for I don't give a fuck,

and you'll get 10% off.

Okay, we got one more.

What is it?

Focus on fewer things for
longer periods of time.

So this is the kind of classic Cal Newport

productivity advice,
- Mm-hmm.

- The deep work advice.

We had an episode with
him a couple months ago

where we touched on this quite a bit.

You know, there's just,
there's a lot of hidden,

he calls it overhead tax.

You could call it like task switching tax.

Like there's a mental tax that comes with

the diversity of information that

we're being bombarded with.
- Mm-hmm.

- So like the simple act of

switching from email to
your phone to a web browser,

to a phone call to a Zoom
call to a notification

like just your attention moving

between all of those things

over the course of like five or 10 minutes

generates much more of a mental burden

than say just reading an academic paper

for those 10 minutes.
- Mm-hmm.

- And it's really
counterintuitive, because on paper,

a stupid Zoom meeting and a
notification on your phone

and checking a Slack message,

like those in a vacuum, none
of those actions are difficult.

None of them are intellectually difficult.

None of them are physically difficult.

They're certainly far easier than reading

a challenging book or paper.

But for some reason that
series of activities

will tire you out much faster

than just sitting down and
reading the single paper.

And so, you know,

a lot of Cal's advice revolves around

being very conscious of like

how you organize all your tasks,
blocking out notifications,

blocking out social media,
staying off YouTube,

getting rid of dumb meetings or,

you know, batching them
together at the very least.

And I mean, I have to say like,

I really think, I think
he's onto something like.

- Mm-hmm.
- I think this is the,

he calls it like the

fundamental challenge of knowledge work.

And I think he's right about that.

And I think it's hard to ignore how

the increase in burnout has coincided with

work that is just kind
of objectively easier

than it was say 50 years ago.

As a population, we're
not out in factories.

We're not like

dying in coal mines,
- Right, right.

- like we were generations ago.

We're sitting in air
conditioned rooms on computers,

with amazing devices in our hands,

talking to people remotely
in our gym shorts,

working whenever we want, however we want,

with the people we want.

Yet we are experiencing a
mental and emotional fatigue

that we haven't really experienced before.

And so I just, it's a really
interesting phenomenon.

- Mm-hmm.
- And I just think

it's so important for our generation

to understand the nature of it,

- Yeah.
- so that we can adapt.

- I think that you're talking
kind of on the micro level,

the daily level, just getting
shit done type of level.

If you step back one level though too,

and just the number of things

that you're focusing on in general.

- [Mark] Mm-hmm.

- I have a problem with
this 'cause I'm just,

I'm fascinated by everything.
- Yeah.

- I'm interested in everything.

Everything like, you know,
everything grabs my attention,

and I go with it.
- Yeah.

- I mean, even when I like out here,

I'm like drilling holes in ceilings

and then I sit down and I'm,

- You literally do.
- we're talking about.

- By the way, everybody,

Drew built this studio.

- I was fishing for that,

I was, yeah.
- With his bare hands.

I'm not even exaggerating.

Like if you pull up the video,

if you're listening to this,

open Spotify, look at the video.

Drew built this fucking
studio with his bare hands.

So I apparently I hired a GC

when I was hiring a research
assistant and I had no idea.

- But okay, that's my point.

My point is though, Mark, is that,

I don't know, there's like,

I feel very much like
the jack of all trades,

master of none type of thing, you know.

And that's what I mean, that next level,

if you back out and you say,

okay, I need to focus on
fewer things rather than

chasing every little,
- Yeah.

- you know, rabbit down the hole.

- So this one actually, this
raises an interesting question

because you know, Cal,

Cal kind of bangs on the drum of

specialized focus,
- Yeah, very much so.

- really drill deep on one thing.

There is a prevailing counter argument.

There's a different, there's
an opposite school of thought.

- [Drew] Mm-hmm.

- There's a great book called
"Range" by David Epstein.

I think Tyler Cowen has talked
about this a bit as well,

or maybe it was Peter Thiel.

But like, the importance of

generalists today.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

- Because,

a generalist today,

because there's access
to so much information

and there's so much disparate
things and opportunities

and different trends and fields

and research coming
out and data coming out

that we actually need
generalists more than ever

simply to tie the thread
between all the stuff out there.

- Right.
- Like if you're

only zoomed in on your
field and you're like,

you're knowledge-based,

you're gonna become too
detached from the wider world.

And actually generalists
are gonna be the ones

who are going to be able to
like keep track of everything.

I don't know if I buy that,

but I think it's a really
interesting argument.

And Epstein in particular, you know,

he tries to argue in his book,

he finds examples of how

some of the people that we
considered domain experts

were actually generalists.
- Yeah.

- You know, like Steve Jobs was

very famously kind of a generalist.

Like he was really into
art and calligraphy

and eastern spirituality

and like all those
things really influenced

his views of technology
and consumer products.

He talks about Roger Federer
and how like Federer,

you would assume that Federer was like

playing tennis all day, every day

since he was four years old.

But it turns out that
Federer actually spent

as much time playing soccer
and a bunch of other sports.

Or like Magnus Carlson,

the best chess player who's ever lived,

like apparently he spends,

when he was like competing
for world championships,

he actually spends his days
playing soccer with his friends

the day before he goes in to
actually play the chess match.

And it like frees up his brain

to be more creative
during the chess match.

So it's an interesting argument.

- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know

where I land or how much I buy it,

but it's out there.

- No, and I've,

I've tried that on before.
- Yeah/

- I've tried to kind of take that view

and I think there is some merit to that.

There's also a great little book.

It's an easy read.

It's called "How To Be
Everything" by Emily Wapnick.

- [Mark] Okay.

- And she talks about
kind of this same thing.

She was very much a generalist
and fascinated by everything

and also left a PhD program

like I did, you know?
- Yeah.

- And which is very common
amongst people like us, I think.

And she talks about what
you're saying is kind of,

if you can find a theme

across these domains.
- Hmm, yeah.

- And I do think,

I do really like it when I am
like feeling scatterbrained,

but then all of a sudden I
find one idea in one domain

and bring it over to another
and tie the two together.

That's very satisfying to me.
- Yes.

- So maybe if I focused on that more,

that would be a little bit more,

more productive for me, I don't know.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- Yeah, I don't know.

I do think we live in a time

that rewards that
- Yeah.

- more than ever before,
- Yeah, okay, okay.

- like intuitively
- Yeah.

- that feels true to me.

But that said, to be able
to make those connections,

you need to be able to
focus on that theme.

Right?
- One at a time.

- I think it's the

one at a time theme,
- It's the one at a time

- that's important.
- that's important, yeah.

- You can't, like Magnus
Carlson can't be playing chess

while he plays soccer.
- Yeah.

- Like he needs to play one
and then go play the other.

- Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, and I don't know.
- Although it would be fun

to watch him try.

- He could probably.

- If anybody could do it,
- He could probably do it.

- it would be him.
- Yeah,

if anybody could do it,
- Yeah.

- it's probably him.
- No, for real.

For real.

- All right.

What else? Is that it?

- I think that's it.

I think that's the pod, Mark.

- I still don't feel successful, Drew.

- Yeah?

- Perhaps it's just a faulty
definition of success.

- That could be, that's
a whole another podcast.

- That's a whole another podcast.

- That's a whole another podcast, yeah.

- Well, until we dig into that,

until we dig into my
faulty sense of success

or lack of success,
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

- that's all for today's episode.
