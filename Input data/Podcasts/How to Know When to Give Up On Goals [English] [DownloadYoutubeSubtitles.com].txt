- So, as listeners and
viewers probably remember,

we started the year,

you and I talked about
our goals for the year,

and then we asked the podcast audience

to submit their goals for the year.

And we promised that
halfway through the year,

we were going to follow up ourselves

and follow up with the audience

to determine how disciplined
is the Mark Manson audience

or how bad are we fucking up?

And so this is what we're
here to discover today.

We've sent out the survey.

We've heard from the audience.

Drew and I have our goals.

We know how far we've
gotten with our goals

or haven't gotten with our goals.

And so today's podcast episode is,

it's a return to goals
and a discussion of,

when does it make sense to give up a goal?

Because there are many
circumstances that it makes sense

to give up a goal,

and when you should just shut the fuck up

and grit through it.

And we're gonna try to
figure that out today.

So I don't know, where should we start?

- Let's start with our goals.

And then we can move on
to responses that we got

from everybody.

We got some good responses.

We got a lot of, a big
response from the audience.

So let's start with ours.

Then we'll get into that.

- Okay, should I go first?

- Let's hear yours.

What happened with the marathon, Mark?

- Let's start with the failure. (laughs)

Let's kick this off.

- It's gonna make me look
a lot better. (laughs)

- Let's kick this off with
an abject failure, right?

- What happened?

- Okay, so to refresh everybody

or anybody who didn't
listen to that episode,

my goal for the year
was to run a marathon.

I turned 40 this year.

I, like, really got in
the running last year.

I was like, you know what?

You know, it's a great 40-year-old goal.

Like, there was a marathon on my birthday.

I was like, this is perfect.

Let's do a marathon.

So I started training for a
marathon, actually, in November.

And then we did that
podcast end of last year,

came out first week of January,

made it very public that I
was going to go on a marathon.

And actually, the only marathon I ran

on my birthday was a
marathon of tacos in Mexico.

There's no way around it.

I didn't achieve the goal.

I gave it up probably early February,

late January, early February.

Maybe five weeks out.

- Oh, was it that early?

Okay.

- Yeah, it was maybe five weeks out.

Yeah, but I feel good about giving it up.

So I want to use myself
as a case study of,

and audience,

I mean, Drew, keep me honest.

If it sounds like I'm bullshitting
myself, please tell me.

Because this is the tricky
thing about giving up goals is,

like, you sound reasonable to yourself.

Like, we all find reasons to
justify not sticking with them.

But, you know, sometimes
we're full of shit,

and sometimes we are being reasonable.

I personally think I'm being reasonable.

So here's what happened.

There are two things that I discovered.

So initially, I started
training for the marathon,

really enjoyed it.

Was going very, very well.

Once I worked up to around 10 to 12 miles,

two things happened.

One is started really disliking it.

Just a lot of pain, which
I've since learned from other,

like, from people who have done a lot

of endurance sports that
that probably stemmed

from training too quickly,

like, pushing myself too quickly,

which is something that we
talked about back in January of,

like, having unrealistic
expectations of what is achievable

in a certain amount of time.

So you could chalk up that
could be part of the failure,

is that I overestimated how
much I was capable of achieving

in just three or four months.

So once I got into double-digit mileage,

body started really hurt.

Recovery became very difficult.

Just felt like my energy
was sapped all the time.

Had started having trouble
getting out of bed.

Second thing that I didn't account for,

I didn't realize, was the time commitment.

Like, you see these training
regimens of like, oh, okay,

you're gonna run 6 miles on Tuesday

and 4 miles on Wednesday

and 3 miles on Friday and
then 12 miles on Saturday.

Like, you look at that and you're like,

"Okay, well, that's a cool challenge."

Well, you don't realize that's
like, 6 hours of running.

And then when you add in
prep, warm up, stretching,

recovery, everything afterwards, like,

you're dedicating, like,
10 to 15 hours a week

just to training,

and we're in a place in the business,

like, we're growing, we're scaling.

I'm working a lot.

I have a lot of business related goals

that are higher priority.

And so being off in the mountains,

running for 12 hours a week
and then being exhausted, like,

another 30 to 40 hours a week,

I just started to realize
that it was incompatible

with other goals in my life,

with a lot of the professional goals

and career goals that I have this year.

And it kind of forced me
into a situation of, like,

does this even make sense?

I'm exhausting myself doing
something I don't enjoy

and actively harming things

that are more important to me.

You know, is running
this arbitrary distance

really that important?

Like, is it making my life better?

Is it making me happier?

I came to the conclusion,
no, it's not that.

There are plenty of ways
that I can maintain my health

and get in great shape

that don't involve suffering
a dozen hours a week

and interfering with all sorts of, like,

work goals and life goals,
and not to mention, like,

spending free time with my wife.

So I dropped it, and I felt good about it.

And I still feel good about it.

I have zero regrets about it.

Tell me, am I full of shit?

- No.

That actually doesn't sound

like you're bullshitting
yourself or anybody else.

It doesn't, because I think
you're being intentional about,

like, okay, I thought this thing

was the most important thing
at this time in my life,

and it turns out it wasn't.

I mean, I think that's a very,

that's kind of one of the
criteria you should use.

Is it really that important to you?

And I think a lot of people,
when they get into these goals,

and I think we'll talk about
this later, too, they find out,

they're like, "Oh, this actually
isn't that important to me.

I thought it was."

Your health is very important to you.

- Yes.

- But like, this one, like you said,

this one arbitrary goal of a
distance run on a certain date,

is that really that important compared

to all the other things that
are going on in your life?

- I think you raise a
good point there of, like,

prioritization,

because there was a
period a couple years ago.

So when I was really overweight and much,

much more unhealthy, there was a part

of my fitness journey
that I realized I had

to make it the top priority in my life.

One of the reasons I got

so out of shape earlier in my life is

because I always prioritized work

and social life over health.

And so I had a period

for a couple years where
I had to prioritize health

over work and social life.

There is a context where that makes sense.

If I was, let's say I
was 60 pounds overweight,

horribly out of shape.

I mean, maybe not a marathon,

but maybe making health
this year the top priority,

maybe that makes sense.

But for where I am in my life,

I'm pretty satisfied
where I am health wise.

Like, I don't feel like I need to,

I have no desire to be
like a David Goggins

or a bodybuilder or anything like that.

Like, I just want to be healthy.

And actually, the area

of my life that I have
extremely ambitious goals

is not health.

It's actually more work related.

So to me, it makes sense to keep that

as the top priority at
this point in my life.

So I still have fitness goals.

I have new fitness goals.

We'll talk about them later.

I think they're more
reasonable fitness goals.

They're probably more
appropriate fitness goals,

but I think this is the
thing that gets missed.

I think there's way too
much emphasis put on,

what is the goal and did
you achieve it or not?

I think those two things, like,

it's actually less important

than what the process teaches you.

So, like, setting the marathon goal,

it taught me a lot about
what matters to me,

what is actually important
at this point in my life.

And by letting it go,

I was able to replace it with
actually a better goal for me,

a goal that makes more sense
for my current lifestyle

and makes more sense for
my current fitness goals

and is basically just
going to make me, like,

a happier and healthier person overall.

So ultimately, it's like,
the goals should be used

as tools to advance you towards
behaviors that are closer

to your values.

And what people lose track of

is that if you set the wrong goal

or the goal isn't completely accurate,

then it can lead you down a path

of behavior that actually takes you away

from what you value in your life.

So you have to be, like, very,

very observant of when
that starts happening

and then stop yourself and be like,

"Okay, this is a bad goal.

I should drop it and replace
it with something else."

So I'm curious.

Your goal was to sleep better this year.

I'm curious, A, what sort
of progress you've made,

and B, did you decide that
that was a waste of time

and have you replaced it
with a more important goal,

like bench pressing 300
pounds or something? (laughs)

- Well, yeah, no.

The thing about sleep

is that it's not really
a goal I can ignore.

- It's never gonna go away. (laughs)

- It's never gonna go away.

So, I mean, yeah,

I could give up on trying
to get better at it,

but it's like, it's just
never gonna go away.

So it's constantly there with me.

I have gotten better.

I've had it's fits and starts.

- Okay.

- The thing is, is that
now that I've been more,

I've paid more attention to
it, and I know, kind of like,

what makes me get better or worse sleep,

and I've had stints where
I've had really good sleep

over the last few months.

I am even more aware of
when I don't get good sleep,

and it's worse when I don't get sleep.

- So let's start with
specifically, what have you done?

What are the measures that you've taken?

- I did cut back on my caffeine.

A lot of people were very
concerned with my caffeine intake,

because it was brutal.
(Mark laughing)

Like I said, five or six cups, I think,

is what usually drink.

I've now capped it at three cups a day.

I usually only do two,
but I hard cap at three.

- Okay.

- I think the caffeine, that
didn't help a whole lot.

I think if that's gonna help,

I need to just cut it out completely.

- Yeah.

- Which I'm not quite there yet.

The screens,

screens, especially later at night.

I had a very strong suspicion

that that was a big
impediment to my sleep.

And turns out it was.

I've capped that at 10:00 p.m.

I tried to do 9:00 p.m.

and didn't really see much of
a difference, I don't think.

So, 10:00 p.m. no screens after that.

That seems to help quite a bit.

If I have screens open later
than that, it definitely,

definitely fucks with my
sleep quite a bit, yeah.

- Interesting, okay.

- I've gotten way better at
regular exercise as well.

Surprisingly, that doesn't
seem to matter for myself.

- Really?

- Yeah.

Whether I get a good
workout, a bad workout,

any workout, no workout.

It doesn't really seem to affect my sleep.

- You know what's funny?

And I've noticed this with
fitness goals over the last year.

Sometimes if a workout's
particularly, like,

really intense or strenuous,
I actually get worse sleep.

- Yeah.

And later in the day, too.

If I do it later in the day, like,

an intense workout later in the day,

a light workout later in day is fine.

But, yeah, I've also kind of,

I did some tracking, too.

I've never been huge on
tracking, but with, you know,

your stories about your tracking

and how it's helped you and
a lot of other people, too,

I did some kind of just basic tracking,

not super detailed or anything like that.

That's helped a little bit, too.

And I can see that I have
incrementally gotten better.

Like, I plotted my sleep time,

actually on a graph and stuff like that.

There's a slight upslope on
how much sleep I've been doing?

- What was your kind of average per night

at the beginning of the year?

And then what, roughly,
where is it at now?

- Yeah.

So the way I tracked,
it's a proxy, it's not.

- Is it like a score?

- Yeah, basically a score.

- So what, like,

what score were you kind
of at when you started?

- So I was usually getting

in like the 60 to 70
out of 100 range before,

and now I'm like,

consistently in the seventies
and hitting in the eighties.

- Nice.

- Which is, yeah, it's
incrementally better.

Really, what I would like
to get is like 90 and above.

And kind of consistently
get there, you know,

at least like five nights
out of a week or whatever.

For that, I think I'm going

to have to do some more drastic things.

One thing I started
experimenting with too, was like,

the light exposure, early morning stuff,

and then getting a little bit at night.

That was sporadic.

I think for the rest of the year,

I'd really like to get into that

and really even do like a
sunlight protocol of some kind

or something like that.

I think that would help me quite a bit,

because I did notice that it
helps at least reset my clock.

If I get some good morning sunlight,

I've got good energy
for the rest of the day.

- Yeah.

- So I think that I'm
pretty sensitive to that,

and I think that's why screens
fuck me up so much too.

- Where have your struggles been?

- Like, where have you fucked up?

- Screen time, sometimes I'd
like to just veg out at night,

like throw a screen in front
of my face and watch dumb TV.

I watched all of "Rick and Morty."

- It's so good.

- It's like, I binge
through that a lot of times.

I was doing it late at
night and I was like, okay,

gotta shut this off.

And that's another thing.

It's just we know what we need to do

and we don't do it even with these goals.

And I don't know what that's about still.

I don't know what that is for me just yet.

- I had a friend who was, like,

completely addicted to his
phone, social media, everything,

especially at night.

It was causing a lot of problems.

And he did something crazy,
which I really admire,

which is so you can buy these plugs

that have a timer on them.

- Yeah.

- And you, like, preset
when they turn on and off.

He put those plugs all around the house

and then he set a password

on them that he didn't have access to.

I think he gave it to
his wife or something.

But basically the router
that was plugged into,

that the Wifi went through,

was set up with one of these plugs,

and the plug shut off at 9:00 p.m.,

so it's all the Internet in the house

went off at 9:00 p.m.

All the TVs went off at 9:00 p.m.,

and there was no way for him to,

unless he, like, goes and, like,

crawls under the console

and unplugs everything and re-plugs it in.

It's basically like child
protecting yourself.

I do think stuff like that is underrated.

I used to hear that stuff,

and I'm like, that's ridiculous.

Like, that's so over the top.

But it is funny.

Like, we really are
creatures of our environment,

and so much of our behavior
is influenced by incentive

and availability, and yeah,

if you just control the
availability of something.

- Environment matters.

- It matters a ton.

- It's huge.

What I noticed though, too, is that,

like the environment, and
also external pressures,

for whatever reason, they
work really well for me.

So, like, just doing this
podcast, setting that up,

setting that up for me,

that puts the pressure on me that I need.

I think everybody's kind
of different around that,

but there's so much
around, like, oh, like,

you should only be doing your goals

for intrinsic Y values, right?

And stuff like that.

I'm like, "Ah, you should
set up your environment,

and make there be external consequences

to your behavior, for sure."

- Sure, I mean, social
pressure is a real thing,

and it's never gonna go away,

and you might as well leverage
it for your advantage.

Like, you're never gonna stop
caring what people think.

And so if you go tell all
your friends, you know,

"Hey, I'm gonna quit smoking,"

and then a week later,

you light up a cigarette in front of them,

like, that's embarrassing, right?

So, like, you should be conscious

of how you're using
that to your advantage.

What else?

What else are you, any
plans going forward, or?

- I realized I need to get
a little bit more specific.

I was just like, "Get better sleep."

- Right, how do you measure that?

- Yeah.

And so I realized that

through the tracking, I'm
like, oh, I don't know.

And a lot of people reported

that tracking has been the
most beneficial thing for them

and valuable thing for me.

- It's a classic business
principle, right?

Like, you improve what you measure.

- So, yeah, I think getting
more specific, and like I said,

get my scores, if I can get
those more in the eighties

and nineties more consistently,

I think that's a good
tangible goal that I can see

in front of my face.

That would help me a lot, I think.

- And you were saying
that now that you do,

you have experienced some
good nights of sleep,

when you don't get one,
you're just like, fuck me.

- I see the extremes
now, and I see like, man,

if I don't get a minimum of
6 hours, I am just useless.

And it's this vicious
cycle too where it's like,

I got a lot to do tomorrow
and stuff like that.

And I start getting in my own
head and I don't sleep well.

And then all that stuff I need to do now,

I'm doing it very shittily
or something like that.

- It snowballs.

- [Drew] Yep.

- Sometimes I think part of
it's getting older, but yeah,

if I don't get 6 hours, I mean,

I might as well just
like call the day off.

I might as well just call in sick.

- Seriously, yeah.

- Because it's, even if
I do brute force my way

through the day,

I'm going to do such a poor
job at everything. (laughs)

- Yeah, yeah, it's just a waste.

- It's kind of like, what's the point?

(upbeat music)

All right, so let's get
into the survey stuff.

We asked you guys to send us your goals

at the beginning of the year.

We had, was it 1,400
people send in their goals?

- Almost 1400, yeah.

- 1,400 people sent in their goals.

Then we sent out a survey
last week asking people

to report on how they've been doing.

Here are the results.

Drum roll.
(drum roll sound playing)

- Yeah, well, if we start off

with the goals you all did submit,

again, about 1,400 people
submitted something.

And we had you write out, you know,

what's your goal and everything like that.

And I kind of just did
a brief summary of them.

They're around a lot of the
things you would expect.

A lot of them like career
and professional development.

People, you know, either
trying to get a raise

or get a new job.

- What was the most common one?

- The most common was fitness and health.

Losing weight or running a marathon,

or, you know, stuff like that.

Most common was around that.

Next one was like career stuff,

kind of getting financial
stuff in order too,

that was a common thing.

- Saving money, getting a raise.

- Yeah, yeah.

So a lot of the common ones,
which is not surprising,

but also like, yeah, that's
what you would expect

because people kind of
all want the same thing.

But, yeah, so things
like changing careers,

starting a side hustle,
that was really common.

Or just like improving skills.

Like, a lot of people wanted

to teach themselves a new coding language

or design program or something like that.

Mental health was a big one, though, too.

People, you know, they're
like, I need to do some things

to really improve my mental health here.

Whether that was just like
taking more time to themselves

or taking more time off
work or self-care stuff,

that kind of stuff, you know.

Learning and education, too.

We got a very learning-hungry crowd,

which doesn't surprise me at all.

Some people are doing
some kind of cool stuff.

One guy was, he wanted to
learn machine learning and AI

by taking Nvidia's.

- [Mark] Oh, cool.

- This, like, course
that he wanted to take.

And I was like, that's a
pretty cool thing to do.

- [Mark] That's a good goal.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- But then, like, cool
personal projects, too.

It always surprised me,
like the audience we have,

you guys are always working
on cool, really cool stuff.

Like somebody was working
on a graphic novel,

which is really cool,

writing a book on their
philosophical theory,

developing a sports trading app.

Like, there was just really cool stuff.

People were like, you're aiming
high, and that's awesome.

In terms of results,

about 80% of people said they
have stuck with their goals,

which is pretty good.

Really good.

20% say, "Now I've given up on that."

- What are the exact numbers on that?

- Exact numbers, so 78.1%
said they stuck with it.

- How many people
responded to this server?

- About 300.

- 300, okay.

Teaching moment.

- Okay.
(Mark laughing)

Teaching moment.

All right, this is actually
really good, I'm glad.

- Is this a statistics lesson?

What are we doing?

- I'm glad this happened, because, well,

this is important because,

and I think this is important

for the audience to hear, because.

- Okay.

- There's a lot of podcasts out there,

a lot of journalists out there

that you will see things
like headline, you know,

"New study finds that 80%

of people stick to their goals in June."

You know, and it's
everybody's like, "Oh, my God,

that's so much higher than
I would have expected."

Blah, blah, blah.

And, guys, I cannot
tell you how many times

if you actually go look
at the survey data,

there's some things that if
you know what to look for,

a few things stand out.

So we mentioned just a few minutes ago,

1,400 people responded in
January with their goals.

We sent out a survey last week.

300 people responded.

That's 20, 25% of the original people.

So that's actually,

most people didn't respond to our survey.

- Right.

- Now, if you did not
stick with your goal,

do you think you're more likely

or less likely to respond to the survey?

If you did stick to your goal,

do you think you're more likely or less?

So it's like, what we're
probably doing is like,

most of the people who stuck
to the goal probably responded.

I would guess.

We don't know for sure,

but my guess is that there's going to be,

this is what's called
selection bias in research.

And this is why a lot of
survey research is flawed,

is because it's the way
the survey is constructed.

It filters who's going to
actually respond to the survey,

whether intentionally or unintentionally.

In this case, it was unintentional,

because we asked everybody.

But there's probably a lot

of people out there who
didn't stick with their goal.

They feel kind of bad about it,

and they definitely don't want to tell us,

so they don't fill it out,

whereas there's probably a lot

of people who did stick with their goal,

and they're feeling really good
about it, and they're like,

oh, I can't wait to tell Mark and Drew

about sticking with to my goal.

So this 80% or the 78% or whatever,

it's probably very skewed.

And there's definitely a selection
bias flaw in this survey.

So I want to just put that
in front of the audience.

The next time you see
a big headline saying,

"Survey says" or "Research
says that," yeah.

"Social media makes everybody miserable,"

it's like, okay, well, go
look at the sample size,

look at how they ran the survey.

And I'd say at least 50% of the time,

there are fundamental issues
with the survey itself.

- 100%.

Yeah, this is not scientific,
what we're doing here.

- No, no, no.

But it's, I like to
bring this up frequently

because this is a huge
problem in our industry,

a huge problem.

There's a lot of podcasts out there

that will parrot shit like this.

Like, there are a lot
of podcasts out there

that would get this result

and be like, "80% of our audience
sticks with their goals!"

Like, "Check out the Mark Manson podcast,

his audience is crushing it," right?

And it's like, no, not really.

It's not a representative sample.

It's got extreme selection bias.

There's probably issues you
could find with phrasing

of questions and stuff.

So I just want to put that out there.

I think it's really
important to point that out.

It's a huge problem in the industry.

I know people who listen

to this podcast probably listen
to a lot of other podcasts

in the space or read a lot
of other people in the space.

There are some people

in the space who are very
aware of these sorts of things

and they know how to filter for them.

There are a lot of people

in this space who don't know
a fucking thing about this

and will just repeat
whatever statistic they find

that sounds interesting.

So be wary.

- Okay.

- Off my soapbox. (laughs)

- No, for sure.

I mean, it is a good point, though,

because we tried to mitigate
that a little bit, too,

because in the email we sent
out asking for responses,

you know, you said, "Hey,
I gave up on my goal,

so it's okay if you did too.

I just want to know."

- [Mark] Yeah, right.

- So we tried to mitigate
that a little bit,

but obviously there's still, you know,

some shame attached to that

for some people, I'm sure, and whatever.

- It's also just a simple, like,

it's less exciting to fill out a survey

about a goal that you gave
up three months ago. (laughs)

- Yeah, no, for sure, for sure.

And I totally get that.

You know, that said though, too,

of the people who said
they gave up on the goal,

60% said they didn't regret it.

- Yeah.

- [Drew] So, you know.

- Which is also interesting

because I imagine that's
probably skewed as well.

- Yeah, definitely.

Like, it's the.

- I don't regret it.

I can't wait to tell them
about how I don't regret it.

You know, there's probably a large number

of people who gave up on
it and feel bad about it

that we're not hearing
from, I would assume.

- Well, okay.

- That said, good job!

(celebratory sound effect plays)

- No, seriously though.

- Way to go team, 80%!

- There was some good stuff in here.

There's some good kind
of qualitative data.

- Let's hear.

Yeah, let's hear from the
people who stuck with it first.

- Yeah, so the people who stuck with it,

we asked them, what did you do?

Like using any of these tactics,

we can give them a menu of tactics that,

and what did you do to
help you achieve this goal?

About 55, 56% said productivity

or other inspirational content.

So they're watching YouTube videos

or listening to the podcast
like these or whatever.

The next highest one,
though, was tracking.

Almost half of the people
said they use tracking.

And some of the comments
later we'll discuss

that was a big one, like
I mentioned earlier.

Journaling, about 35% of
people use journaling too.

25% used accountability partners.

- [Mark] Nice.

- 15% were using coaching of some kind,

which is kind of cool.

And then one interesting one I found,

about 18% of people said they,

this is of the whole
survey, this is everybody,

said that they didn't
use any sort of tactic

or anything like that.

- Wow, just brute force.

- Just brute force.

Just one guy said, "Pure
fucking determination."

That was his other.

- Good old willpower.

I found it kind of interesting too.

Again, this is not scientific
and it's biased data,

but about 20% of the people who gave up

on their goal said they
didn't use anything,

while only about 10%

of people who stuck with it
said they didn't use anything.

So people who were using some

sort of system of some kind
seem to do a little bit.

- Clearly helped.

- Yeah, it helped them.

- Yeah.

- Which I found was pretty interesting.

We had them too fill out, like,

what was the most
valuable thing you learned

out of all this?

And a lot of, again,

the tracking people didn't
realize how valuable.

A lot of people were like,
"That actually helped me a lot."

And just then, that's
just something simple.

A checkbox every day or whatever it is.

And for me too, again,

the tracking really helped me quite a bit.

You already mentioned
this a little bit too.

You alluded to this,

but the self-discovery
that people experienced

as a result of setting,
just setting the goal,

and I think that's
another underrated thing

about goals that people don't,

whether you achieve it or
not kind of doesn't matter.

It's what you learn about
yourself along the way.

People, repeatedly, people were like,

"This was definitely like an
eye opening self discovery."

- Absolutely.

- And I think that's one of the most,

if not the most valuable
things about setting goals.

- And it's funny because that discovery,

it can go different.

Like, I've always had this
weird fetish, I think,

that a lot of people have for
just like, really grueling,

challenging, painful things, ordeals.

You know, it's like the
guys who run do Ironmans

and climb Everest and all this shit.

Like, I've always had this kind
of sick fascination with it

and romanticized it to a certain extent.

And my whole life I've
always kind of, like,

fantasized of doing something like that,

accomplishing something like that.

But it's one of those
things that I discovered

about myself that it's like,
when I'm actually out doing it,

it feels completely
meaningless and purposeless.

I'm like, what am I doing out here?

Why am I here?

But I know there's a lot

of people that find a
great amount of meaning

and significance in it, but it's like,

that happens all throughout our life.

There's something when we're
on the outside of something,

we look in and it seems very meaningful

and like it's going to enrich
our lives in a bunch of ways.

And then we actually get
in and start doing it.

And you're like, "Oh, no, no, no.

It's not the thing I thought it was.

You know, maybe I should
find the next thing."

And then sometimes it works the other way.

Sometimes from the outside,

something seems completely pointless.

And like, why would you ever do that?

And then you go do it and you're
like, "Oh, this is amazing.

I can't believe I waited
so long to do this."

- Yeah, like, you look at people
who are like ultra runners

or something like that,

and you look, like me, I
look at that and I'm like,

"Why do you?"

- Why, yeah.

- That's just, why?

And then you talk to these
people and it's like, oh,

they're all in on this and
there's like a life around it.

- You know, there's all
sorts of things like that,

that function that way.

And it's not just physical activities,

it's creative activities.

One of the examples I use
frequently is that I used

to want to be a musician

because my conception
of what a musician was,

was getting to perform to audiences.

And then once I actually got into it,

what I realized is that 95% of your time

as a musician is spent either practicing

or dealing with rehearsals
and logistics and bullshit.

So you need to love
practicing and rehearsing.

Those are the people
that become musicians.

The performance is just the cherry on top.

- Yeah, and then one other
thing I'll mention, too,

which kind of stems from a lot of that,

people often cited to the value

of being flexible and adaptable.

And I think you've
talked about this a lot,

but I don't know if you've
ever specifically addressed it.

But, you know, life happens, right?

There were some people
who, like, they were doing,

they had this workout goal,
and they got injured or,

you know, a family emergency type

of situation came up that
they had to deal with

over a longer period of time.

And I think a lot of people
just had an appreciation for,

like, I don't control nearly
as much as I think I do,

and that's okay.

- What are you talking about, Drew?

You fucking skip that funeral,
you get that run in. (laughs)

- Yeah, right, right?

Exactly.

Like, shit like that, right?

Obviously, you need to be adaptable.

But I think people were just like,

oh, life is still going on.

The world's not stopping for my goals.

- It's funny, because,

I mean, I know I've said this many,

I said this on the last podcast, too.

I think the goals get oversold.

The goal itself is not the point.

The point is, it gets you off your ass

and doing something that
teaches you something.

That's what's meaningful.

The goal itself is usually
completely arbitrary

and I'd say nine times out of ten

isn't actually the
thing that is rewarding.

Occasionally it is.

Occasionally, you do have a goal,

and it is actually the thing
that makes you really happy,

and it is very rewarding.

That does happen.

But I think that's a minority of the time.

That's the exception.

The majority of the time,

the goal is just kind
of this arbitrary thing

for you to aim at,

and it just gets you off the couch,

gets you out in the world,

gets you working on yourself,

learning, growing, doing different things.

And it rarely works out
the way you expect it to.

Often, my experience is that most goals,

even when I hit them,

it's a mixed bag.

It's like, okay, well,
that was worthwhile.

Like, when I was losing weight,

I had a lot of weight loss goals.

And as I hit them,

there was never this,
"Oh, my God, 30 pounds!"

It was always this mixed bag of,

like, okay, well, that was really hard.

And I discovered that I have this

kind of fucked up relationship with food.

And I realized that my social life

is probably contributing
a lot to my health issues,

so I'm gonna have to
reexamine my social life.

And it just became this very
bittersweet thing of like,

okay, well, I hit the goal,

but that actually seems like
the least important thing

that's going on right
now, because the path

to get to the goal raised
all these other issues

and made me aware of all
these other things happening

in my life that now I
need to address those

and think about those.

- There was quite a bit
of that in that responses.

People were like, "I was
gonna try to get healthy,

but actually I realized that
I smoked too much weed,"

(Mark laughing)

or whatever it is,

or I need to quit smoking
first or something like that.

I'd say too, one thing
I've learned from this,

I actually don't set a ton of goals.

And I realized this

is another self-discovery
thing I figured out.

I don't set a ton of goals,

and it's because I'm a perfectionist

and I'm just afraid of failure.

(Mark laughing)

Why set yourself up for failure

so starkly like that, you know?

What I found, though,
through all of this is,

and listening to you talk

about this has been more like, it's fine.

It's okay if you don't hit that goal.

So for me, that's just
been like, okay, it's okay.

You can change your goal.

- Yeah.

- Give them up.

You can find new ones.

- You and I are opposite in that regard.

And it's, I mean, I
don't have to tell you.

How many goals have I
set within the business

over the last ten years?

- I can't, uncountable, yeah.
- Like hundreds.

- How many have I completely abandoned

after, like, two months? (laughs)

- 90% of them, yeah.

- Exactly, like it's,

they get you oriented
in a certain direction,

and, I mean, it's the same
within business as well.

You're like, "Oh, we're
gonna drive revenue up 25%

on this product line this year."

And then you get three
months in, and you're like,

"Oh, actually pushing revenue

over here is creating a
bad trade off over here.

And actually, we should
be focusing on this,

because that's a better
long-term opportunity.

Okay, well, fuck that goal."

And it's like, that
goal is basically gone,

but you needed to have that goal

to figure out that that trade off was bad

so you could reorient the strategy.

They're stepping stones.

They're stepping stones.

And whether you actually hit the goal

or not is far less important

than what the process teaches you.

I guess that's the moral of the story.

- For sure.

(upbeat music)

- Feeling like a rundown
old diddle? (laughs)

(beeping sound plays)

Do you feel like a
rundown, old dildo battery?

Well, strap in and strap on,
(upbeat music)

because this episode
is powered by Timeline,

the sexy Swiss science geeks
of vitality and longevity.

Timeline isn't just any
old crusty science company.

They're like a bunch of hot nerds

in lab coats figuring out how

to turn back the clock on aging.

And they have the secret
weapon called Mitopure.

Their formula contains urolithin A.

Sounds fancy, but really its just

like a cellular cleanup
crew sweeping out the old

and making way for the new.

Just like switching out that
old dildo battery. (laughs)

Who writes this?

Imagine yourselves getting
a deep, deep, clean,

scrubbing away the gunk and
making everything shiny and new.

You feel a lot less like an old cat lady

and more like a finely-tuned
machine. (laughs)

Just take two soft gels a day, and bam!

You're bursting with energy,

rediscovering forgotten muscles, (laughs)

and bouncing back from quote
unquote workouts like a pro.

For breakfast-lovers,

their berry powder is the
secret ingredient your smoothie

or yogurt needs.

And guess what?

I've got more good
vibrations for you, (laughs)

because Timeline is giving you

a sweet 10% off your
first order of Mitopure.

Just head over to Timeline.com/idgaf.

That's timeline.com/idgaf.

Oh my God.

We made it through.

- Okay, so before we get
into your updated goals,

maybe what we're going to
do for the rest of the year,

do you have kind of,

can we sum that all up a little bit

and just give people like maybe
a couple of rules of thumb?

Obviously, there's no real algorithm

for when to give up on a goal

or when to stick with it
or anything like that.

But do you have kind of, you
mentioned a couple of them,

I think, already.

Can we kind of tie this up a little bit?

- So the principle is that
your goal should be moving you

towards your values.

And the moment that they stop,

they start moving you
away from your values,

that's when it's time to give it up.

And I think another time

to give it up is when you
realize that to achieve one goal,

you actually need to go back.

Like the smoking example
is a great example.

Sometimes what you realize
is to achieve one goal,

you actually need to go back
and set another goal first.

So that's another example

of putting something on the back burner.

Also, the realistic
thing, it is very hard.

We're human.

We suck at predicting the future.

We suck at having a realistic sense

of what's possible to
accomplish in three months

or six months or a year.

We tend to overestimate or
underestimate what is possible.

And so the realism is part of it as well,

is oftentimes you'll set a goal.

It seems like a good
goal, but it's actually,

it's probably unrealistic.

Like, even if I wasn't
having the trade off time

at work to do the marathon goal, like,

let's say I had tons of free time,

and I had the time to just
fucking spend every day

of my life running,

I probably could have powered
my way through the marathon.

But a couple of the people I know who,

who do a lot of endurance stuff,
they told me they're like,

"Very good chance you
would have gotten injured,"

just given the rate of,

that I was trying to push myself

and lack of experience and everything.

So even if that trade off hadn't existed,

it might have been an unrealistic goal.

But again, sometimes you
don't know if it's unrealistic

until you start, you know?

Sometimes you have to get
a month in and be like,

"Oh, this is fucking impossible." (laughs)

- Right, yeah.

- Let me, let me change the goal now.

Let me, like, move the,
move the goal post back

and be a little bit
more realistic about it.

So I think those are three
principles that people can

kind of follow, engage to,

to know when a goal is worth dropping.

- Yeah, I think there's some research

on when goals do turn
bad or toxic or whatever,

and they're definitely, like,

the findings are definitely
in line with that.

A lot of times they've done this really

at the organization
level more than anything.

Like, organizational
psychologists study this a lot,

and one of the things they find
is that when you set goals,

and I think we're very aware of this,

when we do this in the business, anyway.

When you set goals,

it often incentivizes people
for bad behavior of some kind.

And this can happen on
an individual level, too.

Like, if you're like, I set a
goal to make this much money,

then you go out

and you start screwing people
over or something like that.

Well, you hit your goal of making money.

It goes back to the values thing

that you were talking about.

- It's funny, I noticed

I did a crossfit workout last weekend

for the first time in,

like, three or four years.

And I actually thought about this

because when I'm working out alone,

like, let's say I'm doing an extra.

I'm doing, like, squats,

like three sets of ten or something.

When I'm by myself, I count every rep.

You know, I'm like, I don't overestimate.

Like, I don't fudge one.

You know, it's like, did I hit ten?

No, I got nine.

Okay, write down nine.

It was funny.

I went to the Crossfit
gym, and as you know, like,

a lot of crossfit gyms,
they put you in teams,

and they set time limits, and
they give you, like, you know,

all right, you got to do 50
burpees in this amount of time

and all this stuff.

And so I started doing this workout,

and I started fudging reps.

I started I'm like,

"You know, that kind of counted."

Like, I'm like, okay,
well, I'm supposed to 50.

I'm at 47.

That's close enough.

You know, let's move on to the next one.

Like, I found myself.

I start cheating.

As you were saying that,

because I've seen that research, too,

that an overemphasis on goals

actually makes people less ethical.

And it reminded me of that,

of like, I remember sitting
there going through this workout

at this crossfit gym.

I'm like, I have not cheated
on reps, like, in five years,

but suddenly I'm surrounded

by all these other dudes
who I'm competing with,

and now I'm like, "Okay, I'm
gonna fudge on this one."

You know, it's just funny.

It's human nature.

I thought of another one,

another circumstance that
you should give up a goal.

If you feel like you've already learned

what you wanted to learn.

This is more for probably
like an educational goal,

but sometimes people will set a goal of,

oh, I want to get this
certification this year, or,

I want to read ten philosophy
books this year or whatever.

And then you read five,
and you're like, you know,

I kind of feel like I know
everything I want to know.

Like, I don't feel like I'm
getting anything more out

of book number six or
seven, then just drop it.

Like, if you feel satisfied,

you should never feel
like you're just suffering

to hit an arbitrary number.

Anytime you feel like you're
making yourself suffer

to hit an arbitrary number
that people just made up out

of thin air, that's dumb.

You should stop.

Like, everything should
have a purpose behind it.

Every goal should have
a purpose behind it.

And as soon as that purpose disappears

or is no longer clear or is misaligned

with what you actually
care about, drop the goal.

Nobody's keeping score.

Nobody's going to judge you.

Nobody cares. (laughs)

- Yeah, yeah.

I had a goal one year.

It was to read a book a week.

I think I made it almost three months in.

And I quickly came to that.

I was like, what?

- What am I doing?

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- And I was powering through books

that I was like, this sucks.

- Only 100 pages left. (laughs)

- Yeah.

Like, the cheating on the reps thing.

Like, do you give it up or
do you keep going through?

- Yeah, it's like, nobody cares.

- Nobody cares.

- Nobody's keeping score.

- There's one person was like,

"How are you even doing that?"

And I'm like, "I sit down and I read."

Otherwise, nobody cared.
(Mark laughing)

- Was all that suffering worth
that one comment? (laughs)

- No, probably was not, no.

Okay, cool.

So you've given up on your hopes

and dreams to run a marathon.

- For now.

I mean, I might do one one day, but what,

so what I realize now
is that it's much more

of two things.

One is I would have to ramp
into the training slower,

and two is it's more of a time
commitment than I realized.

And so for me to do it again,

I would basically give myself
more time to ramp up training,

and then I would make sure

that I don't have other stuff going on

in my life that I prioritize higher.

- But you do have new health goals.

- Yes.

- This is another reason
I don't think completely

bullshitting yourself is
that you've set new goals

in the same domain.

- Yes.

- Because you still
prioritize your health.

One of the problems I've had
in the past is I'll set a goal

and then I give up on it,

and I'll set a completely different goal

in a completely another area of my life,

just, like, bouncing around.

Like, not really giving any thought to it,

not being very intentional about it.

So I think that you're not
completely bullshitting us

because you've still got.

- I pass the Drew Birnie test.

- Caveat that you pay me to say that, but,

(Mark laughing)

still, what are your new health goals?

- So I should say
slightly related to that.

I do like to set domain-specific,

I feel like I should
always have a health goal.

I should always have a
business or professional goal,

and then I should always have, like,

some sort of personal goal.

So, yeah, my new health goal,
what I realized, I basically,

I've been on this four or
five year health journey.

Most of that involves weight loss.

I'm pretty thin now, pretty skinny.

I'd like to get stronger,
especially, like, now that I'm 40.

Been doing a lot of reading on
longevity, long-term health.

- Lifting is great, yeah.

- And it's basically,
yeah, it's like build up

as much muscle mass as you
can while you still can,

because that's what's
gonna kind of carry you

in the old age.

- Helps with your skeleton
a lot with your bones.

- Yeah, so I'm taking,

I realized that, okay,

probably the next step is
to try to add some lean mass

and get stronger.

So I have goals in all three
of the main major lifts.

Squat, deadlift, bench press.

And so I'm working
towards those this year.

PRs in all three hopefully this year.

- I'm not going to,

but I want to ask you
what you bench, bro, but.

- I'm not very strong.

(Mark and Drew laughing)

I'm not very strong.

I'm not very strong.

I want to,

they're pretty simple numbers.

So I want to be able to deadlift
300 pounds for five reps,

one set of five reps,

squat 250, one set of five reps,

and then bench 200, one set of five reps.

And I'm like, right now I'm
probably like 260, 215, 220,

and then like 175, 180.

- Okay, cool.

- So I'm like, it's possible.

It's doable.

- Okay.

What are you doing?

You're on a regular workout
schedule and everything?

- Regular workout.

Yeah, regular workout.

I've up protein, eating
at a slight surplus,

so I've actually gained a little bit

of weight the last couple months.

Travel has honestly been the
biggest challenge with that.

Traveling a lot for the
YouTube channel, and, yeah,

that's the biggest challenge.

So staying consistent with those workouts,

it's funny because it used

to be I was always very
consistent with exercise

and my diet was terrible.

Now it's kind of the other way around.

Like my diet,

I feel I can kind of keep my diet

in line without too much trouble.

But hitting three

to four workouts a week
consistently has been tough.

- Yeah, especially with your schedule.

And again, the travel thing, that just.

- It wrecks everything.

- Yeah, it does.

- Everything.
- It does.

- What about you?

- [Drew] Well, yeah, so.

- How do we get you to sleep perfection?

- I really do.

I want to do more of the light protocols,

like sunlight protocols.

Try that out.

And some of the things
I've already mentioned,

just to kind of double down on those.

I think I need to get a little bit better

with the tracking, too.

I've been using kind of
crude, rough ways to do that.

I don't like wearables, really,

especially when I'm sleeping,

so that makes it a little tougher.

But I have,

now that I've seen the light

and the value in the tracking,

I think I want to get a little
bit more specific with that.

- Tracking is fucking.

- It's magic.

- It's game changing.

- Like the simplest stuff
too, a checklist or whatever.

- It's so dumb.

- A box you check every day.

- It's so dumb, but it
makes such a difference.

I'm really happy to see
that people are seeing that

across the board.

Tracking is what changed
my wife's sleeping.

- Yeah.

- It was the big unlock for her.

And then with me, with diet,

it was probably the single big,

it and quitting alcohol were

like the two biggest unlocks for me,

fixing my nutrition, was
tracking and not drinking.

- Yeah, so I think by the end of the year,

if I can hit those scores of,

like in the eighties or above, say,

four nights a week, I was thinking about,

that'd be about, so
more than half the time,

I think that's a good goal to start with.

I think it's realistic

and it's definitely achievable for me,

but it would also be a little
bit of work to get there.

- And is the biggest thing, the screens?

Is there something else you can do?

- I think it's, I mean, short of,

- Ketamine, maybe. (laughs)

- Yeah, sort of just sedating myself.

The big one, I think, my ultimate boss,

and it just, I don't know,

I can't, caffeine.

I have kicked so many
bad habits in my life.

Caffeine, for whatever reason, is just,

I can't do it.

I've tried before,

but I think I can get there eventually.

I'm just not sure if that's
one I'm gonna let go just yet.

- I did about six months
without caffeine in 2019, 2020.

Fucking sucked.

It's a life not worth living.

- I haven't made it more
than a day, so. (laughs)

(Mark laughing)

I haven't.

- I quit just because my
wife gave me so much shit,

and I did it to prove that I could.

And then I had a few months
where I'm like, you know,

I'm going to see if this
really makes a difference.

And then I got, like,
three or four months in,

and I'm like, this sucks.

Like, I miss caffeine.

And I went back to it.

- It's glorious.

And when I don't have it,

it's just like, everything is, like, dull.

And honestly, like, colors
look different to me.

Like, it's pretty wild,
which obviously, like,

just highlights how much I depend on it.

- How dependent.
- Yeah.

- I mean, if you're gonna
be dependent on anything.

- It's not the worst.
(upbeat music)

- [Mark] It's probably the best.

- Yeah.

- Cool.

All right, man, that's a wrap.

- That's the pod.

- Just quick reminder, if
you're watching this on YouTube,

to go to The Subtle Art
of Not Giving a Fuck

Podcast YouTube channel.

We're moving the whole
podcast over in July.

You'll be able to watch everything there,

so make sure you go over, subscribe there.

New episodes will stop showing up

on the Mark Manson channel soon.

See you there.
