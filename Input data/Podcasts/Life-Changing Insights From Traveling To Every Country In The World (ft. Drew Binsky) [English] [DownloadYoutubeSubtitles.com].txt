- If you could meet a North
Korean, what would you say?

If you were shot at in
Somalia, what would you do?

If you got attacked in the Congo,

where would you go?

Drew Binsky has experienced
all of these things.

He's a travel vlogger, a
YouTuber, and an author.

He has spoken to North
Koreans in North Korea.

He's alluded bombings in Somalia

and visited Syria during
the height of its civil war

to volunteer and help civilians.

Drew has been to every
country in the world.

He has seen the most dangerous places

and survived the most destructive regimes,

and that makes his message
all the more surprising.

Most people, most of the
time are good and happy.

Most of them will help you

even if they have nothing.

According to Drew, human
resilience and optimism

has no bounds.

Even in the worst places on earth,

you will still find a heavy dose of hope.

Travel has been one of
the most important parts

of my personal journey.

I've not been to as many
countries as Drew has,

but I have found no better
education on humanity

and human nature than visiting
as many countries as possible

and trying to understand their cultures.

It teaches you what you believe

to be universal was actually
merely your own cultural bias

and the things that you thought

were unique about your culture

are actually kinda universal.

It's one of the most important things

that I've ever done for
myself and the education I got

is still paying dividends today.

And that's why when I had the opportunity

to have Drew on the show and
hear his stories, I took it.

In this episode, you will
learn why Drew is drawn

to war zones, failed states
and impoverished countries,

and what he's learned from all of them.

Why you should never, ever judge a country

or culture based on what
you saw on the news.

Why the most impactful trips
are rarely the most fun

and why the most fun trips
are rarely the most impactful.

What Drew's favorite
country in the world is

and which country had the
biggest impact on him personally.

Why the real damage of
war cannot be measured

in death tolls or economic statistics,

and why you never hear
about the true repercussions

in the headlines and where
the friendliest people are

in the world, and how
they became that way.

Drew also shares some of
his basic travel tips on how

to be more spontaneous,
how to connect with locals,

what he looks for when he
travels, and much, much more.

So enjoy this one.

It made me a little bit nostalgic

to get back on the road myself,
but more about that soon.

This is Drew Binsky. Let's get into it.

- [Announcer] Bro, do you
even podcast. Like, bro.

This is "The Subtle Art of
Not Giving a F*ck Podcast"

with your host, Mark Manson.

- Drew Binsky, thanks for
coming to the show, man.

- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

- You as well.

- Yeah, why don't we start with kind of

a broad philosophical question.

What is universal in the world

that most people assume is not?

- That's a good question.

Everybody has a heartbeat

and everyone's blood is red.

So that's a lot of people are like,

"Aren't people different?

Aren't you scared to go places?"

I'm like, "Everyone is generally friendly,

so wherever you go in the world,

people are gonna look out for you."

And that you hear about terrorism

and you hear about things that bad people,

but in general, like people
are dying to meet you.

They just don't get
the chance to meet you.

So that's kind of what I've realized from

even like African tribes
where you really don't have

that much in common on the outside,

but on the inside, they gotta find food,

they gotta find a way to make money.

They gotta sleep somewhere.

They gotta send their kids to school.

So that's kinda the main overarching thing

that I've learned.

- It's like basic human needs and desires.

- You don't necessarily
realize that until you go

to like South Sudan

and you're sleeping with a tribe
and you're just like, whoa.

And like they just, the
little kids are playing around

and they're punching each
other and it's like, yeah,

it's the same thing that
you do when you were a kid.

- Yeah. Yeah.
- And it's really

rewarding to see that.

- What would you say, you know,

especially going to these places

where you're obviously a foreigner,

what would you, like what percentage

is the response immediately warm

versus maybe tepid or
skeptical or antagonistic?

- 99% warm.

- Wow.
- Yeah.

- Wow.

- The American thing, I don't
really hide being American.

Maybe in some countries at
certain times, I would avoid it.

Like if I went to Russia
right now, I dunno,

I might say I'm Canadian just to avoid,

you know, extra questions.

But like Iran's a great example.

They love America. They
love, absolutely love.

And you would think that
they don't like America

or maybe the government, whatever,

but I'm applying for my visa
to go back for a third time.

I really like it there.

And they're super cool and
they all have an uncle,

I mean, we're in LA right
now, I mean, there's like a,

there's a million Persians in Iran.

It's the biggest Iranian
influence outside of the country.

But like that's a great example

of this wrong misconception.

People just love American,
ask you questions about it.

They grew up on TV and music.

To answer your question,

99% of people would positively, yeah.

- I actually ran into
that in Russia as well.

I mean, it's a little
bit more polarized there,

but I remember everybody, when
I was in Russia, everybody,

every Russian that I
met was like so thrilled

that I was American.

And finally I asked a
couple of 'em, I was like,

like our governments hate each other.

We just went through like 70 years

of a Cold War, you know?

And they were like,
"Ah, it's like brothers,

you beat each other up,

but it's because you love
each other." (chuckles)

I was like, Okay.
- Yeah.

- (chuckling) Sure.
- Yeah. It's like that though.

I mean, that's not just Russia,

it's other places too, you now?

- Like here domestically, you know,

the vast majority of us are not satisfied

with our own government.

We don't necessarily
agree with all the things

that our government does or stands for

or says to other countries
or other cultures

and you, I think we forget that

most people in the world are the same.

Like hey don't really agree
with their government either.

They don't like all the things

that their government's doing either.

- Yeah, and when you turn on the news,

you're only getting the negative stuff.

- Yeah.
- 'Cause that's how

they get interest from people

and that's how they make money.

The headlines are always negative.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- I would say the one place that I went

where I told them I was American,

that they were a little bit
standoffish was North Korea.

- Yeah. (laughing)

- I can speak a bit of Korean,

so I was able to kinda like talk to them,

but it wasn't that they were
like scared of Americans,

but they just, all they
know about America is,

you know, propaganda stuff that...

- [Mark] Yeah.

- And so they were just kinda like

really shocked when I said I was American.

But then I talked to them

and one guy invited me to play tennis,

so it's just like, they're just people.

- How did that come about,
the North Korea thing?

- I went on a guided tour in 2017,

flew into Beijing and then
did a mandatory briefing,

and then spent three days in Pyongyang.

And I'm one of the lots
Americans until now

to step foot in the country,

because when I came back,

if you can remember Otto Warmbier,

I was in North Korea when
he was in labor camps,

and I knew that was going on.

- Wow.
- And then as soon

as I left North Korea,
I was living in Bangkok,

so I went back to Bangkok,

and Otto went home to
Ohio and passed away.

And then that was the moment

that President Trump banned Americans,

I dunno if he did, but
Americans became banned

to visit North Korea until now.

So I think I'm one of the last dozen

or so Americans to step
foot in North Korea.

- Were you aware of
that before you went in?

- I knew I couldn't like break the rules.

- Didn't, (laughing) well, yeah.

(laughing) Didn't that
worry you, like where did...

- You attend a mandatory
briefing in Beijing

and it's basically like
the do's and don'ts,

which is mostly don'ts.

- Yeah.

- And I just followed
the rules and I went.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

It was really interesting.

- Yeah, what stood out about it?

- It's dark and depressing
and really isolated.

And a lot of the buildings,

like you would imagine, are empty.

There's like really tall hotels.

There's like a hundred-story
Pyramid Hotel in Pyongyang.

If you've seen a picture of
the skyline, you've seen it,

and it's empty, it's weird.

- Wow.
- And

the coolest part was I did a 10K

in the marathon, the Pyongyang Marathon.

- Okay.
- So it was like

half foreigners and half North Koreans.

I can't run a full marathon,

but I just did that as an
opportunity to like mingle

with the people on the
side, shaking hands,

like talking a bit.

- Yeah.
- So that was kinda cool.

- Did the people seem anxious
or nervous to talk to you?

- Yes.
- Yeah.

(Mark laughing)

- 'Cause I said like, (speaking in Korean)

which means I'm American.

And that's the first
time I opened up to them

and then they were just like
really shocked to hear that.

But then I just told them
I lived in South Korea,

they actually don't hate South Korea.

Korea-
- Interesting.

- Before 1953, Korea was one country.

- Yeah.
- And a lot

of people don't know this,
but in the first few years

after the Korean War,
North Korea was thriving

and South Korea wasn't,

and then it switched in the 70s.

So that's pretty recent.

Like my grandfather was in the Korean War.

They still have the same last names,

like Kim, Park, Chen,
like it's very similar.

- Yeah, and it's, well,
you hear stories too of,

there's like siblings and cousins

who were separated 60
years ago and, you know,

haven't reunited, or reunited the DMZ or-

- Right.

- Stuff like that.
- But culturally though,

like they're very similar

- Yeah.

- The way they speak and, I mean,

the language has evolved a bit,

but like kimchi and like the way they bow

and the way they have
respect for the elders

and like that stuff's all the same.

I could talk about Korea a
lot, but I'm sure we got a lot,

I'm sure we got a lot of stuff to go to.

- I got a question for you around,

you mentioned that, you
know, you followed the rules.

You learned the rules and you went

and you followed the rules.

And I think a lot of people are, you know,

hesitant to go places
because of safety issues

and stuff like that.

Obviously you've put yourself

in some very dangerous situations,

but it seems like you've really
done your homework before.

And I think that's kinda
one of the antidotes to

not being, or putting yourself
in dangerous situations,

is having that knowledge before

and just following the rules.

What kind of preparation
do you do when you go

into some of these places?

- My answer might not be
what you're expecting.

I actually am pretty spontaneous

and I kinda go with the flow,

but that being said, I know,

I get in touch with
the right local person.

Usually it's one person who is
either a licensed tour guide

or someone who's very
familiar with traveling

around the country and
understands my mission,

which is to document and tell stories.

And I kinda put my trust into them

and they, you know, show me a good time.

And this has worked in Mainland Yemen,

eight-day road trip with one Yemeni guy.

Afghanistan, I spent
a month in Afghanistan

and two different trips, Iran,
Somalia, Pakistan, Congo.

I don't go in completely alone.

I go in, I travel solo to these places.

Like on the plane, I fly solo,

and then at the airport I'll
meet up with a local person

and then, you know, I trust,

I've done my research,

due diligence with them through Zoom calls

and asking questions and
making sure they know the plan.

And from then I just,

I'm just with them

and then trust that I'll be safe.

And to this day,

I've never been mug, kidnapped,
robbed in every country,

so I think that says something.

- How much of, like, does
understanding the culture

or the history or the politics play a role

in just kind of understanding
those do's and don'ts?

- That matters a lot,
'cause in some countries,

like in Syria where when you go there,

I went there in 2019,

and all the buildings
were destroyed around me.

And certain regions are off limits

and some questions you
can't ask to people.

So I do have to know those things.

But I think the more I travel,
the more I've realized,

like, I pick up on social cues,

and I'm just good at, like,
I'm good in these situations.

It's like, what's it called
when people know a lot

of languages, what's it called?

- Polyglots.
- Polyglots.

They say once you get
past five, six languages,

they become much easier

because there's like certain cues

in different languages
that just make like..

- Just pattern recognition.
- It's kinda similar to that.

It's like the more you
visit war-torn countries

or conflict zones, you
kinda understand the layout

of the land and how to approach it.

I wish I had a specific answer,

but it's more of just like
experience kinda helps with that.

- Well, back to the trust thing though.

I've heard you do vet a lot
of people on social media-

- Yes, definitely.
- You talk to 'em

beforehand and stuff like that.

You have to lead with trust

in those situations, I'm guessing.

And you just freely give trust.

What have you kinda learned

about human relationships
through that, I guess?

It's crazy, you've already
said 99% of people are warm

and open to that.
- Yeah.

- But when you lead with trust like that,

I think there's even another level to it.

- There's trust until the trust is broken.

And just very few times, maybe
you can count on one hand

how many local friends

or fixers, that I like to
call them, they help me out,

that they've steered me
wrong, not dangerously,

but it just wasn't, there
wasn't a connection there.

And at those points, I just
would make an excuse or leave

or find a way to get out of it.

But a lot of these people
are my followers too

that have joined the journey since 2017,

since I started making videos.

So they know exactly
what I'm trying to do,

which is document like
cultures, get inside homes,

and, like we talked about Bourdain,

like he's my inspiration
for doing all this stuff.

So just the way he can
break bread with people

and like sit down and have a conversation

and it's all about the people.

It's not about the nature
or, nature is cool,

but I never, I don't even
consider nature when I travel.

- Yeah.
- Everyone's like,

"Isn't Switzerland the most beautiful?"

I'm like, "Personally," I'm like,

"I just think it's boring."

I mean, there's not, I
don't wanna pick on...

- Apologies to the Swiss
listeners right now.

- There we go.
- I don't wanna

pick on Switzerland.

I was in Berlin yesterday

and I was talking to Germans about this,

but maybe I shouldn't pick on Switzerland,

but like it's great to have nice nature-

- I mean, Switzerland's neutral, right?

Like they'll be fine.

- They're neutral, but like,

they're just really, they're
not so open to be filmed

and it's just more of like
a private kind of culture,

which you'll find a lot in Western Europe.

But yeah, I travel for
people, people stories.

I wanna know how people are living,

what's their religion,
what are they eating,

why do they do certain things, customs?

- You mentioned earlier
that you went to Syria,

either immediately, like
during or immediately

after the war.

- During.
- Okay.

- Yeah.
- What brought that about?

- Well, I was visiting every
country. So that's a country.

- It was on the list, it was
the next one on the list.

- You couldn't wait for the war to end or-

- No, so getting,

so getting, this is a good
story that I haven't told much.

Getting the Syrian visa, it's in the book,

was impossible for Americans
and still kind of is,

but now there's a loophole
that you can get it.

So the only way I was able
to get into Syria in 2019

was through a French,
a Christian French NGO,

the founder of that was a follower.

And he was like, "Hey," he
DMed me on Instagram was like,

"Hey, I can help you get the,"

it's a volunteer visa, so
it's not a tourist visa.

- Yeah.
- If you come to volunteer

with our organization,

we can get you into Syria.

And I said, "Sure."

And it took like six months of back

and forth paperwork, interviews,
and finally I got the visa

and I got it in Beirut,

which is just a two-hour
drive to the border.

And then I was able to cross over land.

I still thought when I got to the border,

they were gonna deny me, but I got in.

And so I went, the whole time,

the whole 10 days I was in Syria,

I was with this Christian NGO
and I was volunteering a bit,

and then I would go off
and shoot my YouTube videos

and then I would go back.

I was sleeping in bunk beds with all

of these French volunteers for
this, spreading Christianity.

I'm Jewish, so I'm in Syria.

I'm in Syria, I'm with the Christian NGO,

like trying to document Muslim
culture or Arab culture.

And I ended up traveling
around the country with them.

And it was really, it was really great.

But that was the only way I could get in.

And I was just really curious to know

what life is like in Syria

because all the surrounding
countries I love.

- Yeah.
- Lebanon, Iran, Iraq.

So I just had a really good time in Syria.

- What did you learn during that period?

- That people are resilient.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Even though like, I
was interviewing people

and the background is just rubble,

like just all the buildings are collapsed

and they were just like, yeah,

we're hoping for a better tomorrow.

Like I was inside of their shops

that are just completely bombed,

like a room like this,
but everything's bombed.

And, you know, some tears are shedding

and they're just like, we can't wait

for the country to rebuild.

And that's crazy.

- Yeah.
- Like you can say people

are resilient around the world,

but I haven't seen resilience like that.

- Yeah.
- You know, where

you're physically like
in a place that you have

to be stepping over giant like rocks

just to get into the place.

But Syrian people are really friendly.

Like before the war, it was thriving.

It was a tourist destination.

Like there's a beautiful
Mediterranean beach in Syria

and people don't even know
that there's beaches in Syria.

Beautiful beaches, like
crystal clear water

and food is great.

I mean, it's Mesopotamia. It's
the cradle of civilization.

You know, so everyone
knows that word Mesopotamia

'cause we studied it

in third grade.
- Of course.

Yeah, the bread basket of the world.

- It's like, I told my
parents I was going to Iraq

and they were like, "Be careful on this."

"I'm gonna Mesopotamia" and
they're like, "Oh, that's cool."

Like it's the same place.

- It's in Iraq. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Quick check-in, how is
your brain doing today?

Is it like a serene spa

especially when we're juggling
a million things at once:

work, bills, family, friends, your health,

it really is like a carnival at times.

But for me, a therapist was
like a personal tour guide,

helping me through the chaos.

He helped me find more
balance and clarity in my life

and I learned a lot of great coping skills

that I still use to this day.

He helped me set healthy boundaries

and he helped me get through
some difficult relationships.

So if you're considering therapy

- Well, we kinda touched on this already,

but there is this media perception

of these certain places, Syria
and other places like that.

What are some of the biggest
gaps you've seen between

the media portrayal

and like your boots on the
ground assessment of it?

Because, like for me,

I have a lot of deeply
held beliefs about people

in places I've never met, never been to.

Recently that's kinda been
eating at me a little bit.

And I was wondering if you
could give some perspective on,

okay, this is like,

is there some horrible place we all think

is a horrible place that isn't?

Syria might be one of them.

What have you learned
about that sort of thing,

the media disconnect from reality?

- Afghanistan's a good example,

but in general, to answer your question,

the media usually has an agenda where

they're talking about negative things.

Very rarely I will turn
on CNN or whatever media

and they're like sharing a
positive story about a slice

of culture in the Middle East.

Afghanistan, I've been twice.

This most recent time was
right before Taliban takeover,

but I've had many friends go

to Afghanistan since Taliban takeover

and they told me it's very safe.

The Taliban are trying to push tourism.

For what it's worth, I'm not
saying I support Taliban,

but that's an example.

I met a lot of Taliban
and that's an example

of a country that is pretty safe,

I would say as a tourist.

Like they look out for you,

they're really hospitable,
people in Afghanistan.

They will like break their knees for you

to sleep in their house and
offer you tea and stuff.

And it's a beautiful, beautiful country.

So that's one place I think

that I don't think anyone's ever heard

a positive story about Afghanistan-

- I was just gonna say,
there's still a reaction in me,

but I'm like, no, that's bullshit.

Right, like that's, but,
I mean, I believe you,

but there's still like this
visceral reaction to that-

- I've made 14 videos in that
country and I hope to go back,

but almost all of them have been positive,

just about different places and cultures.

And it's just like, I met
the last Jew in Afghanistan.

He left now, but there
was one Jewish person left

and he runs the synagogue in Kabul.

And that was like one of my
favorite stories I've ever-

- Wait, he ran on a synagogue in Kabul?

- There's a synagogue in Kabul
- With one Jew

in the whole country.
- Yes.

And he keeps it orthodox. Yeah.

- So he was the only one who
would go to the synagogue or-

- Yeah, yeah, so the rabbi
that he communicates with is

in Tashkent Uzbekistan,
the next country over.

And, yeah, he keeps all the kosher

and all the holidays and stuff,

but he now left the country.

So there's now zero Jews
left in Afghanistan.

But that was one of,

that was one of my
favorite stories I told.

But there's so many little
corners of that country that's,

there's 35 million people there.

Like that's a lot of people.

That's almost, what,
California has 50 million?

- Yeah.

- So 80% of the population

of California, that's Afghanistan.

- Yeah.
- That's crazy

when you think about it like that.

That is wild. Yeah.
- Yeah. I like it.

You brought up a point
that I've definitely found

to be true as well, which is the worst

the reputation of a place,

the more the locals almost
overcompensate for that.

- Yeah. True.
- Like

they, like we just got
back from El Salvador.

We were talking about
it before we went live,

doing a YouTube video on it,
and it was the same down there.

It was like everybody was like,

"Oh my god, Americans are here."

Like roll out the red carpet. (chuckles)

This is our chance to make
a good impression, you know?

- It used to be really dangerous
up until a few years ago.

- Yeah, absolutely, I mean,

highest murder rate in the world.

- Yep.
- Six or seven years ago.

And it's become very safe now.

And the video will be about
kind of that transition.

But to your point as well, you
know, about the resilience,

there were a number of people
that we talked to down there.

You know, I would kinda,

I was asking them
questions about the changes

and I would say like, "Oh,
you must be really happy now."

And I remember there
was this one old woman

and she said, "We've always been happy."

She's like, "Even when the
gangs were killing everybody,

we were still happy.

It's just now we're safe."

And I was like, "Touche."

- The story, I can't wait to
watch your video, by the way.

- Yeah.
- When's it coming out?

- Probably July.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

- The video that's coming out
tomorrow on my YouTube channel

is from the biggest favela in Sao Paulo.

- Oh, nice.
- I went there two months ago

and similar like, people
were like kissing my feet

that I came as an American

and I was kind of, I've
been around Brazil,

but not Sao Paulo and not the favelas.

And I just went with a local friend

and we just walked through the streets

and that was really interesting.

But the people were smiley, happy.

Like the police are too scared to go

to this place 'cause they'll get shot at.

- Yeah.
- And so gangs

and drug lords run this place.

- Yeah.
- It's called Paraisopolis.

But I found people to be really fun,

and they kept telling me, they're like,

"Everyone around you right now

is like involved in crime and stuff,"

like kidnappings outside of the favela.

Inside the favela, what's going on, guys?

How you doing?. Really friendly.

Like looking after,

they don't wanna commit
crime in their own place,

'cause everyone knows each other.

I thought that was really interesting.

There's like a bubble
of safety in this place,

but these guys are all
criminals outside the favela.

But I was talking to them
like face to, like this,

asking them questions about it

and they're open about it, it was crazy.

- Yeah, the favelas in Brazil,

I'm gonna ask my wife about that.

She's from Sao Paulo.

- Oh, okay.
- And I lived down there

for a couple years.
- Oh, you did? Nice.

- Yeah.
- Do you know Paraisopolis?

- I've heard of it. I've never been.

- Yeah.
- But I've been to,

I've been to a couple of
the favelas in Rio and,

yeah, it's a wild dynamic.

Like it's kind of a, there's almost,

especially during
Carnival, like there's all

these parties up in the favelas

and it's almost like,

it's kinda like when an
armistice is called, you know,

you hear stories like World
War I where the French

and German soldiers played
soccer on Christmas?

Right, right. Yes.
- It feels like carnival

is that in the favelas.

It's like, okay, we're
all, no crime for a week.

We're all just gonna hang
out and have parties together

and then we'll get back
to robbing you next week.

- That's kinda what it's like though.

- Yeah.
- There are really

kindhearted people in Brazil in general.

- Yeah. Oh yeah, super warm.

- Yeah, so I agree with
what you just said.

(Mark chuckling)

- The world is a funny place, man.

It's like, it's...

- Where else have you lived, by the way?

- So I was nomadic for seven years.

- Cool.

- [Mark] So I spent about a year

and a half in Southeast
Asia, mostly in Thailand,

but also Vietnam.

And lived in Brazil for two years.

Spent four years in South
America, primarily Brazil,

which is where my wife's from,

but also Columbia and Argentina,

and then a little bit in
Europe, here and there.

- Nice.
- You know, Russia, UK,

Germany for a little while.

- Cool.
- It was amazing.

I mean, it's like one

of the best things I ever did

- Yep.
- Is

live abroad and just travel and explore.

- I was nomadic for about
seven, eight years in Asia.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- Yeah, it's...

- Yeah, it's great.
- Any young person,

it is one of the, I mean, anybody,

but like, especially if you're young,

'cause it's easier when
you're young, you know, it's-

- It's the best thing you can do.

- It is.
- It's the best thing

you can do, period.
- It is.

It's the best education.

- Yep.

- Like it's, to this day,

it's still paying dividends.

I actually, it's interesting.

I've had this conversation
with my publishers.

My books have been, I think,

number one in like 13 or
14 different countries.

And I've talked to agents and publishers

and they're like, "This
is kinda, this is crazy."

Like the international
appeal, they're like,

usually it's just the English market

and maybe one or two other
languages or maybe it's,

you know, here, like, there'll
be like one random market,

like Japan, it takes off.

But I really attribute that

to the amount of time I spent abroad,

because these questions of like,

what is universal that
most people don't realize

is universal and then like
what is actually particular

to American culture, that
most Americans don't realize

it's particular, like.

- Right.
- That I think

in a nutshell,

that has informed a lot
of my career success.

- It makes sense though.

Like I grew up sheltered in America.

Like probably all of us did.

I went to University of
Wisconsin. I was in a fraternity.

I was living in a frat
house and I loved that life,

but I didn't know of, I
thought that was just normal.

It was normal. It was normal.

- Sure.
- But then-

- In Wisconsin, yeah.
- Yeah. It was great.

But then I studied abroad in Prague

and then I taught English
in Korea for two years

and then it just totally shaped my world,

like what we're talking about.

And then when I come back home, you know,

things are pretty much the same here,

but what's in your head is different.

- Right.

- And I just think that
people should travel more.

It just makes you more wise,
well-rounded, respectful,

and understanding of how people live.

- Yes.
- Which is really important.

- And I would say it is clarified,

I feel like I have a much clearer

and better relationship
with the United States.

- Same.
- For living abroad.

'Cause you come back and
you, now you actually,

like now I feel like I actually know like

what's good in the US and
what's not good in the US.

- Right.
- Whereas, you know,

I think it's easy

to get caught up in all
the political narratives

and news media narratives and stuff.

And a lot of that stuff
is just like way off base.

- I agree completely.

- Completely skewed.
- And the US is great,

by the way.

- It is.
- It's huge.

- Yes.
- It's massive.

It's almost bigger than Europe, I think,

if you include Alaska in size.

It's bigger than Europe.

50 states, 64 national parks,
which are all beautiful.

There's a lot going on here.

I know we're like a world power

and we have a lot of
influence on the world,

but if you forget about
that and just think about

as a destination to travel,

you can get in a car and
just freely drive anywhere.

And it's pretty great.

- Well, that's what I always say too,

but people are like, "Why
don't Americans travel?"

I'm like, "First of all-

- That's the main reason why.
- We're huge, yeah.

- 'Cause we can travel
anywhere within America.

But like Arizona, Utah,
Colorado, California,

if you've drive in those states,

it's some of the best in the world.

- Yeah.
- It's probably the best

road trip in the world.

- Yeah.
- That circle.

- I live in Colorado.

- You do?
- I would agree with that.

Yeah.
- It's so great.

- Love Colorado.
- And we do take that

for granted because we just, you know.

- It wasn't until I moved
to the US with my wife

and she was like, "I wanna do road trips."

And I was like, "Ugh, really?" (chuckling)

You know, as someone
who grew up in America,

I was like, "Really, a road trip?"

And then we ended up doing,

we did a road trip through the Western US.

- It was fantastic.
- Unbelievable.

Unbelievable.
- It's so good.

- It's so, it's gorgeous.
It's absolutely gorgeous.

And I always tell people
to just road trip the West.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- Yeah, speaking of
which, what would you say,

what trip was the most
transformative for you?

- India, so after I left Korea,

I lived in Korea for two
years teaching English.

I was 24, single,

and I had a goal to visit
every country in the world.

I was at about 50 at that time.

And I said India, I
haven't been to India yet.

Three months solo backpacking.

Flew to India and I did,

started Goa, have you been India?

- Yep.
- Okay.

Started Goa in the South, kind of South.

And then I basically took buses

and trains all the way
up through Rajasthan.

So I did like all the
Western and Northwest,

not all. (chuckles)

India's, I've been
seven times and I still,

there's so much.
- It's huge.

Yeah.
- So many places to go.

But yeah, a lot of the Central

and Western India and Northwestern India.

And I just learned a lot about myself.

You know, I was on a shoestring budget.

I wasn't making much money.

I think I was spending 1,000 a month,

including accommodations and
food, which is pretty decent,

I think, for India.

Like you can get a lot of things

for a little bit money.
- Very little. Yeah.

- And, yeah, I just think
my true colors came out

and I was by myself, so,

and I wasn't making YouTube
videos at this time.

I was blogging. I used
to have a travel website.

It was called the HungryPartier.com.

And I basically about food and
nightlife around the world.

So I was like partying in India.

I went to a Switchfoot
concert. Do you know that band?

- Yeah, I know Switchfoot. Yeah.

- Switchfoot in Mumbai.
At the Hard Rock, Mumbai.

I don't think I've ever told
that to anyone until right now.

This just never came up.

I went to a Switchfoot concert,

met a lot of cool people,
and unfortunately I got

in a bus crash in India and
two people died on the bus.

It was towards the end of my trip.

And so to this day, I don't take like bus,

like overnight buses to get places.

That's a dark story, but
yeah, I learned a lot in India

and I got food poisoning three times,

like severe food poisoning.

I lost like 15 pounds on the trip.

But I've been back to India
six more times since then,

and I'm gonna go back probably again

at the end of this year.

There's so many stories in India.

- I always answer that
question with India as well.

And it's, for me, it's the extremity.

- Yes.
- Like,

I actually wrote an article
about it many, many years ago.

And I think what it is
is like you can have one

of the most beautiful
experiences in your life

on one street corner.

- Yes.
- Walk two blocks

down the street

and have one of the most
horrifying (chuckling)

and disgusting experiences of your life.

And it's on the same street

and it's like the same afternoon.

- Yep.
- The same place and-

- I have a specific
example of that in Agra,

which is the most beautiful
building in the world.

- Yeah.
- Taj Mahal.

I saw, that morning, I saw,

I was driving there and I saw
a dead person in the street.

- Yeah.
- And there wasn't

even like police there
to, ambulance there.

It was just a dead person.

There was people surrounding them.

I don't know how the person died,

but I saw with my eyes a
dead person on the street.

And then an hour later,
I was at Taj Mahal.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- You're you're absolutely right.

It's "Everything Everything
All at Once," what, I don't...

- Yeah, "Everything
Everywhere All at Once"-

- "Everything Everywhere All at Once"

and it's like, you get
a lot of attention too.

And they speak English.

A lot of Indians speak English,

the majority of them, I think.

And so they'll come up to you

on the street and ask you questions.

Not much concept of space,

so they'll be right here talking to you.

And they're friendly
people, very friendly,

but there's a lot going on.

And as you said, like, you'll see it all.

In one day, you'll see everything.

- Yeah, and incredibly hospitable.

But then there's also a lot of,

for lack of a better word, like scams.

I spent about six weeks there

and it was probably at least once a week,

either to me or somebody like at my hostel

or somebody I was traveling
with, like, you know,

we would just get sold something.

- Yeah.
- That didn't exist.

(Mark laughing)
(Drew laughing)

And, you know, it'd take you
a few hours to figure it out

and then you're like, oh,
oh, god dammit, again?

- They're very smart.

Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, they're crafty.

- Yeah, I always say like,

India's my favorite and least
favorite country in the world.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Love-hate relationship.

- It's tough, I've like
wanted to take my wife

for a long time, but I
always tell her, I'm like,

"This is not gonna be an enjoyable trip."

Like this is a trip to
learn about yourself

and learn about the world.

There are gonna be days where you're like,

"What am I doing here?"

- Yeah, I took my wife there
and we had a good time overall.

But it's tricky.

- It's intense. It's really intense.

- I do recommend everyone to go to India.

- It's incredible.
- You learn

so much about yourself, about the world.

It's the most populous
country in the world.

- Yeah.
- It just passed China

like a few months ago.

That's crazy, it's a
third the size of the US

with five times the amount of people.

- [Mark] Which if you've
been to Downtown Deli-

- That's not surprising.
- No, it's not.

There's like people
stacked on top of people,

on top of people, but it
is an incredible place.

Shout out to all the Indian listeners.

We have a lot of 'em.

And yeah, one day I'll go back too.

- Yeah, there's a lot of
stories to tell there, man.

- Yeah.
- As you know.

- It's a wild place.

Except I do give a about money

and you should too.

Do you ever worry

that you're getting desensitized

to this stuff?
- Yeah.

- Like after enough war zones, like

maybe you're like,

the thing that's protecting you
just kind of like gets numb-

- Yeah, I think there's
something like that. Yeah.

- Yeah.
- I think I just don't,

I don't phase at things, situations.

I don't know what like gene that is,

if it's a genetic thing or not, but-

- So that's always been
there or do you think

you've gotten less...

Like were you fearful the first
time you went to a war zone?

- No, so I guess it has always been.

Like when I was a kid, I
never went to war zones.

I don't know what that
having no fear thing is.

I'm sure that's something you've tried

to unpack throughout your career as

a storyteller as well.

Is that a gene?

- I personally think so.

- Yeah.
- I think some people,

you hear it a lot from like military guys.

- Yeah.
- Or like

that free solo climber.

- Yeah.
- Alex Honnold.

- Yes.
- There's a circuit

that's just like not there.

- I just, yeah.

I don't know what it is, but
a lot of people ask me that.

They're like, aren't you
too scared to go here?

And like Mogadishu's the most
dangerous city in the world.

That place is crazy, and
I'm happy to talk about it,

but I went in there
just hanging out, like,

I mean, it's crazy out there.

- What happened there?
How did that happen?

- I went to Somaliland, which
is an unrecognized country.

It's the northern part of Somalia,

and so I wanted to go to real Somalia,

so I went to Mogadishu.

And just to leave the airport,

like the hotel picked me up,

but they had a convoy of
like a pickup truck in front,

a pickup truck behind, all
bulletproof, blackout windows.

And there were four guys
in bulletproof vests

and big automatic weapons on each,

like the bed of the truck,
they were on each corner.

So there were eight guys
and then us in a Jeep,

blacked out windows.

And then every time we'd
have to get outta the car,

for the three days I was there,

anytime I would get out,

all the eight guys would scope around,

look over every fence, like,

and then they would be
like, "Okay, he can come."

And I had like 10 minutes to go anywhere

and then I'd have to go back in the car.

That's how dangerous it is.

- Wow.

- There's kidnappings, attacks.

I stayed in the Hayat

and two months after I left,

the whole hotel was bombed
and like 40 people died

in that hotel, same hotel.
- Jesus Christ, dude.

- I have a selfie in
this like ice cream shop

in the lobby of the Hayat.

And like I saw a picture of

that ice cream shop and it's gone.

So it's just a crazy place,
Mogadishu, unfortunately.

- Do you worry that like,

I mean, 'cause a certain amount
of that is just luck, right?

- Yeah.
- Like

there's a small chance that something

really goes sideways.

- Yeah.
- Each time you go

to one of these places.
- There is, there is.

Yeah, I don't really worry.

- Yeah.

- Is there an adrenaline rush to it?

- Yes, absolutely.

- Yeah.
- Absolutely, the moment I get

off the plane until the moment
I'm gone, there's adrenaline.

I think that's what I'm hooked on.

- Interesting.
- But I get adrenaline knowing

that this is a place
almost nobody goes to,

no Westerners go to

And the fact that I can
document it and post a video

that will probably get millions
of views is really special,

that I can be a messenger
for that part of the world.

- [Mark] Right.

- I'm sure you feel that too.

- Yeah, but, dude, I'm
not going to Mogadishu.

(Mark laughing)

- Lemme know if you wanna go.

I can connect you.

- You can hook me up? You can hook me up?

- What's the most dangerous place

that you've been or that you felt?

- Oh, that's a good question.

I got really drunk and fucked up one night

and went to the wrong part of Cartagena.

And it was actually, I
actually lucked out because...

- Did you go to that
Cuban bar in Cartagena

where they serve mojitos?

It's like a dance salsa
bar, it's super cool.

- I-
- You don't remember. Okay.

- All I know is I went to the wrong spot.

And it was funny 'cause I lucked out

because there was a Colombian guy there

who had studied in the US.

- Okay, cool.
- And so when my friend

and I got out of the taxi,
this guy immediately walked up

to us and he was like,

he was like, "What are you doing here?

Are you guys American?
What are you doing here?"

And I was like, "Yeah."

And he's like, "You can't be here."

- Oh, god.
- You have to go.

And I was like, "No man, like it's cool.

I speak Spanish."

I was drunk as fuck.

And I was like, "It's cool.

I speak Spanish."

And he's like, "No, no, no, you-

- You have to go.
- Don't understand.

Like this part of town, you
cannot be here at night.

- Wow, was it like 02:00 in
the morning or something?

- Yeah, it was 02:00 in the
morning, something like that.

He put us back in a taxi, sent us back to

the old town, which was the tourist part.

- Yep.
- And the taxi started

driving outside of town.

- Oh, that's my biggest fear.

- Started driving the opposite way,

which when you live in Latin America,

you hear stories like this of like,

you get dumped in some random place.

They take all your shit.

- That's exactly my biggest fear.

- And they potentially kill you

or they just leave you out in the middle

of like the Colombian jungle.

And so anyway, I started
realizing what was happening.

I told my friend who didn't
speak Spanish, I said,

this is what's happening, like get ready.

I took a credit card outta my wallet

and put it in the bottom of my sock,

in the bottom of my shoe.

- Yep.
- I told my friend, I said,

"Whoever we get dumped in front of,

just give 'em everything.

Don't fight, don't argue, don't run away.

Like just hand everything over."

Completely mentally prepared for it

and then we came across
a police checkpoint

and the police stopped the car

- Really, random?

- Complete random police checkpoint.

Cops stopped the car,

asked the taxi where he was going.

He like said some bullshit place.

The cop was like, who's in the back seat?

Taxi's like, "Oh, just some friends."

- Wow.
- And he's like,

and then the cop was like,

walked over and he was like-

- And you told him what's up?

- Yeah, and I was like, "I
don't know where I'm going.

I'm American and the cop was like,

told the taxi driver,

"Turn around right now, go
back to go back to town-

- That's crazy. (chuckles)

- Yeah, dude, but I don't
wanna do that again.

(Mark laughing)
(Drew laughing)

- You don't get adrenaline
thinking about that story?

- Dude, I'm like, I'm getting, fuck,

my hands are getting sweaty
just telling that story.

- That's a great story.
- Yeah.

Yeah, so, I mean, one thing
that I kinda mentally did,

and I'd actually be curious to hear

if you did the same thing is

when I decided I was gonna live

in Latin America long term,

and especially once I
married a Brazilian, like,

you know, I'm probably gonna
spend at least a few weeks

in Brazil for the rest of my life,

every year for the rest of my life.

I really just came to peace with it

of like, it's inevitable.

- Yep.
- I'm gonna get robbed

or mugged or pick-pocketed at some point,

probably multiple times.

Every single Brazilian friend
I have has been robbed.

Some in more horrifying
circumstances than others.

So I really just made
peace with it of like

just setting the expectation of like,

this is going to happen.

It's kinda like a tax

of making this this like,
choosing to have this life.

- Right.
- Like,

you know, part of the tax is just,

I'm gonna be robbed like
once every 10 years or so.

And that's fine.

- It's good to set that in your mind,

so when it does happen,
it's not so shocking.

You're not freaking out about it.

- Yeah, like you can mentally prepare.

I think that's important.

- For sure.
- I think that's something

that I do is like,

if I get thrown behind bars
or if something happens,

like I know that that's a possibility.

Especially in Western China,
I know that could happen.

- Yeah.
- And I'd like to think

I'd get outta prison,

but maybe there, I might not.

I was almost the next Britney Griner.

Remember when she was held in Russia?

So I was detained on the border of Russia

and North Korea,

like weeks before Russia attacked Ukraine,

like two weeks before.

And there was already
talk about it happening

and they loved to have, I was
an American on the border,

and they held me for three hours.

They'd stripped me of my phone

and my friends had to be outside

and they asked me every
question I've ever been asked.

And if they wanted to,
they could've kept me.

And then the war broke out right then.

So then I would've been a political pawn

that Britney Griner was,

- Wow.
- It was like this close.

- I've got a series,

I wanna play a quick game
of Overrated Underrated.

- Okay.

- And this is, lemme set
the context for this.

So I'm gonna ask you, I'm gonna give you

a list of things.

This is, tell me if they're overrated

or underrated in terms of the quality

of life for like an average
citizen in the country.

So the first one is government,

overrated or underrated?

- Overrated.
- Overrated. Why?

- I guess, I might change my answer.

(group chuckling)

- I feel like it's probably properly rated

at the extremes and then
overrated for everybody else.

Like if you're in North Korea,

obviously the government is like

the most influential thing or.

- You need government
to have rules and laws,

otherwise everything would be anarchy.

Like there would be nothing.
There would be nothing.

So it's a tricky one.

- Like the average person in Iran

or the average person in...

- They hate their governments, but, yeah.

- Yeah, yeah, like
Afghanistan or Korea or...

- Right.
- Australia.

Like how much influence

does the government actually
have on their day-to-day life?

- Like for women, they
have to wear hijabs, so,

but I think that's changing now

with the whole Mahsa Amini thing.

But there are like certain
rules that they have to do,

but like, they all
badmouth the government,

and they wish it wasn't the case.

But that being said,

they still have to
follow a certain standard

in a place like Iran.

So I think the government's just there and

it's something they
don't wanna think about,

but it's rules that they have to follow.

But I think that they'd much rather,

like Iranians are not religious.

I think like I was there
on Ramadan, I think 80%,

8-0, do not fast.

- Wow.

- Isn't that crazy?

- Yeah.
- Even though all

the restaurants are closed,

you know, the Islamic Republic of Iran,

which is the official
name of the government,

they will make it feel
like it's super religious

and close all the
restaurants until nighttime.

But the people, they're just
eating, you know, undercover.

So that's one example of like, yeah,

the government's there and present.

But like, I'm trying to think like...

- But that would be kinda be an argument

of that it's overrated, right?

- It would be an argument
it's over, that's why,

but I said overrated,

but then I thought about other countries

and I was like, underrated,
so it's like this weird,

it just depends on what country you're in.

- Yeah.
- It's really tough.

Like in Africa, like there's
a lot of bribery and stuff

and that's a whole different conversation.

But I paid a lot of bribes just

to cross land borders for no reason.

- Yeah.
- It's just like,

in order for you to get from
Sierra Leone to Liberia,

in order to cross that
border, you need to pay $300.

And so I paid $300

and that's to a policeman with a gun,

and that's to the policeman.

- And it's probably has nothing
to do with the government.

- It has nothing to do, no.

- It's just he happens to be stationed

at the border. (laughing)

- Yes. Yes, correct.

So maybe that's not related
to the conversation,

'cause it's not the government.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- So the government maybe doesn't have

as much authority in those places.

- This is a hard question.

- It's a really hard question,

'cause I keep thinking of one country

and then I'm switching my answer

to think of another country.

And I was just in Japan two months ago.

That country just works.

Everything works in Japan and Korea.

East Asia, Taiwan, I love Taiwan.

Things work so well there.
There's like no poverty.

Everyone seems to be having
a good lifestyle. Good jobs.

- It's clean. Yeah.
- It's clean. It's safe.

Everyone looks after each other, like...

- But is that the government?

I would argue, so...

- Or the culture of the people, yeah.

- So like, one of the next ones
I was gonna ask is culture.

I personally think
culture's vastly underrated.

- Yeah.

- 'Cause I would say East Asia,

it's cultural-generic mostly.
- I agree, it's built

into the culture to be respectful,

to take care of your elders,
to look after each other.

I think in the US, not to pick on the US,

but we're not that
family-oriented as a culture.

And when we're 18, we get
the fuck out of our house.

In other cultures, that does not happen.

They like will live at home,

almost most of the rest of the world,

they'll live at home

and like be really close to their family

and maybe when they get
married, they'll go live off.

But I feel like that's missing here.

I wish that people were
more closely, you know,

I'm really close to my parents.

They're here now in LA.

I really love spending time with them.

And anytime I get the
chance to share a meal

or take them on a trip, I do it.

But, yeah, do you agree with that?

- It's funny, I think that cuts both ways.

So I agree with you, there
is something nice about

how much emphasis is put on
family in a lot of cultures.

Particularly like Latin cultures.

- [Drew] Yes.

- Asian culture.
- Asian culture.

- At the same time, I have
seen so many people who,

so much enabling of

just, I'm gonna sound like, god,

I'm gonna sound like such
an American. (chuckling)

- You are American, so you're sounding-

- I know, here, get
ready for it, everybody.

Here comes the American in me.

I've seen a lot of enabling,

like when I've lived in those countries

and lived in those cultures,
I've seen a lot of enabling of

what would otherwise be like

a really like self-actualized person.

It's like, well, mom and dad

are always gonna take care of 'em,

so they just stay at
home till they're like 35

and they never really like,
you know, try to like,

try hard at their job and
they don't like don't really-

- That does exist.

- Yeah, and so it kind of
like, it creates complacency.

And it's, you know, I
look at the way I grew up

and, lemme just say, I've
gone both ways on that.

Like when I first lived in
Latin America, I was like,

wow, it's so great.

They put like such an emphasis on family.

And then like as the years went on,

I was like, well, wait a second.

Maybe the fact that like
nobody works very hard,

like has something to do
with the fact that like mom

and dad are gonna fit
the bill for everything

even when you're like 40 years old.

- So why is that a bad
thing though for them?

- Is it? Yeah, I don't know.

- Maybe they'd be thrilled
to have that life.

I just think it comes back to
like the US is very innovative

and entrepreneurial
because of these things.

- Yes.
- When I was 18,

I moved to Wisconsin.

I didn't know anyone and
I just figured out how

to do my own laundry and be,
but like at an 18-year-old.

- Totally.
- And that helped guide me

to live this lifestyle that I live now

because of that.

- Absolutely.
- So.

- I agree, I mean, it's,

you get very much into kind
of this like subjective,

what is a good value
and what's a bad value.

Everything's just a trade off.

And when you look at, say, loneliness data

or mental health data,

these countries that have like

really strong emphasis on family,

their data's not nearly as bad as ours is.

You know, part of our mental health crisis

is that we are so atomized
and independent and alone

and isolated from each other all the time.

We're overworked, overstressed.

- And that's not a good thing.

- That's not a good thing.

So it's a trade off.

Like it's like pick your
poison, whereas, you know,

some of these other countries,

like there's a lot of people
live in abusive dynamics.

There's like fucked up family dynamics.

There's all sorts of stuff that happens.

So I don't know, like
it's really complicated-

- It's not like there's an answer.

Like this is better, this is not better.

It's just cool to analyze it
from a global perspective and

think about these things, you know?

- Well, Mark, you have
this idea that the best,

and the best thing about a place

is usually also the worst
thing about a place too.

I think you would agree with that too.

- This is my pet theory is that, yeah,

the best thing about a country

is also usually the worst thing.

So like the best thing about the US

is if you wanna work hard and make money,

you can do it here.

- Right.
- It's the best place

to do it.

The worst thing about the US

is everything revolves around working hard

and making money, you know?

- [Drew] That's true.

- The best thing about Brazil is it's,

the people are just fun loving, you know,

best parties, beaches,
barbecues, everything.

Worst thing about Brazil is
everybody just wants to party,

(chuckling) go to the
beach, have a barbecue.

- Interesting.

- Darn, yeah.
- That's a good point.

I never thought about it like that.

But you can kinda run
through it with everything,

you know, whether it's
Japan or China or India.

Like I think what it is is that

it tends to be that, you know,

the most extreme traits
about a culture tend

to define both its
advantages and disadvantages.

- Sure. That's interesting, man.

- Yeah. What about war?

- Yeah, war hit me some
daggers here, that's...

(Mark laughing)

I mean, it's underrated if you live

in the country that the
war is happening in.

- Yeah.
- Like if you live

in Ukraine, I mean, that's,

I'm trying to go back to
Ukraine in this summer if I can.

But if you live in a country that war,

like in the US, we don't have
war on the ground in the US.

- Yeah.

- That's a big deal.

If you live in Ukraine,

you are worried that
your buildings are gonna

be destroyed right now.

But in the US, we never have to worry.

And 9/11 happened, but
since then, I dunno,

you can fact check me,
but it's not like we're,

there's big attacks
happening in the US often.

There's shootings, that's
something different.

But we're talking about war.

I think it's underrated

for people living in those countries

because they really, really have

to worry about things happening.

- I'm interested in maybe
like the dynamics of that,

of like physical danger just versus

like psychological stress.

Because one thing that I've heard,

I've never been to a war zone,

but one thing that I've heard is that

the majority of a war zone,
nothing's actually happening.

Like the majority of Ukraine,

there's no bombs dropping.
- Sure.

Ukraine's huge.

- But the anxiety that people live with

every single day of like, you know,

oh, I've gotta go to Kyiv
to like go see my cousin,

like that becomes a terrifying thing.

- That's why I said
underrated for those people,

'cause it's always a
looming thread in your head

and you can't not think
about it all day long.

I'd know that from just going

to war zones and talking to people.

So, I mean, there's not
that many war zones,

active war zones in the world right now,

so that's a good thing.

I think overall as a global culture world-

- Historically speaking yeah.
- Historically speaking,

I think wars are at a low
point, which is a great thing.

But yeah, it's tricky.

If you don't live in a place
that there's, like in Canada.

(Drew chuckling)

- Yeah. (chuckling)
- Yeah. (chuckling)

- Sometimes I say I'm
Canadian just to be funny,

but like, no one has any beef with Canada.

You can't have beef with Canada.

What are you gonna hate Canada for?

- Yeah.
- I think a lot of places

in the world are living just normalizing

they're not thinking about
war happening, which is good.

But for people that are
living in war zones,

it's really tricky and I
feel really bad for them.

Ir really sucks if you're in war zone

and you're a refugee and you
have to leave your own country.

- Yeah. I don't know.

- I worry sometimes, like,

especially with how fast
everything is these days,

how quick news cycles are,

how quick our attention spans are getting,

all the social media feeds and everything.

It feels like we're forgetting quicker.

And maybe part of it's,

I'm just becoming that like
cranky old man that like.

- That's definitely part of it.

- Like I don't know, like I look at some

of the narratives around some of

the geopolitical issues today

and it's just like shocking,

the lack of historical context
that people don't have.

So yeah, I don't know.

That's something I've been thinking about

a lot lately, like...

- So you think we're all
screwed in the future,

like the way we're heading?

- So, you know, media evolves, right?

Like from books

and newspapers to TV and radio to,

and now to the internet
and social media, right?

And again, there are trade offs with each.

And I think what concerns
me is that social media is,

it's extremely good.

Like our current media environment,

I think we have access to more
information than ever before.

So you are able to know a
tiny bit about more topics

than ever before.

So I think like in our
parents' generation,

our parents would probably
know a decent amount about

a few topics and then nothing

about everything else.
- Correct.

- Whereas today, everybody
knows a tiny bit about hundreds

and hundreds of different topics.

So it gives you the
illusion of being informed

when you're not informed at all.

- Interesting.

- And so I think there is more discourse

and wider discourse
around almost every issue,

but the quality of each
discourse has gotten much worse.

Like, dude, have you ever gone back

and watched like a PBS
special from like the 80s?

It's so smart. It's so
fucking smart and nuanced.

Like go watch like an old
"Charlie Rose" program

from like 1985 or like see
an old Carl Sagan thing.

I'm like blown away.

It's like college-level
lectures, you know,

delivered on cable TV.

- And that was the only
thing that they had.

They weren't able to Google it.

They could talk to their friends about it,

but that was it.

- That was it, so not to say that like,

oh my god, we should go back to the 80s.

I'm just saying that like,

we've made this trade off just
based on our media ecosystem.

We've made this trade off,

whether we're aware of it or not,

of like we've basically
traded in a quality

of information on a small number of topics

for low-quality
information on every topic,

every topic imaginable.

And I think that has repercussions,

especially in our politics.

Like I think we're seeing that
repercussion in our politics

and the narratives that go on around it.

I'll put my soapbox away now.

- No, that's good.

It's interesting to think
about these things really,

'cause I don't always think about 'em,

but that's very true.

You could make the argument though

that it's also good to know,

be aware of what's happening

in many different parts
of the world, but yeah.

- You don't want people
to be completely naive,

but then sometimes it's like knowing

a tiny bit in some ways

is worse than knowing nothing,

because if the person

who knows a tiny bit doesn't realize

they only know a tiny bit-
- Yeah, they think

they know everything, yeah.
- So they think

they're informed, anyway.

What's curious to me too
is that this dynamic seems,

it seems to be really
affecting a lot of countries

and cultures and then some other countries

and cultures seem to be
kind of immune to it.

- Right.

- But I have no idea why that is.

So you hit your goal of
visiting every country.

You've got a book about it.

You've got the YouTube channel.

- Yeah.
- Like what's next?

- That's the grand question.
- Yeah.

- I wanna keep telling
stories at a higher level,

which means just getting myself becoming

a better storyteller, interviewer,

just kinda diving deeper
onto certain topics

that I wanna talk about.

And I have a great team who
helps me edit the videos

and, you know, we work
together and we really

just all try to tell the best stories,

and I wanna elevate that.

So our stories have
gotten longer over time,

which is a good thing,

if you can hold an audience for a longer,

especially on YouTube, as you know,

if you can hold an audience
longer, it's better.

But I'm not focused on the destination,

I'm more focused on the story.

So I don't really care where I go.

I just wanna tell impactful stories.

They generally lead me
to places like, you know,

Somalia or wherever, Iran Turkmenistan.

I'm trying to go back to
those two, Western Sahara.

I just got my visa, so generally
I'm in places like that,

but I just wanna tell good stories.

- Last two questions.

What do you give too many fucks about?

- Golf.

(Mark laughing)

- I'm like a massive golfer.

It's my alter ego and I
don't talk about it publicly

because people think it's so boring.

But I really, I was at the Masters.

I like, I'm obsessed with golf and I try

to play in all countries.

- Okay, best golf course in the world?

- The best course is probably Augusta

where the Masters is, but the
best course I've played is

a course called Sacom Tuyen
Lam Golf Course in Vietnam.

- Okay.
- It's the most pristine,

beautiful, yeah, Vietnam's so good.

We didn't talk about
it on this podcast but-

- What part of Vietnam?

- It's near Da Lat. It's
in Central South Vietnam.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

It's a great country all across the board.

It's such a, I love
Vietnam. I used to live in-

- Golf course, I never would've thought-

- Yeah, I lived in Ha Coi for eight months

and it's a really beautiful place, but,

yeah, was that the answer you wanted

or was there any answer?

- It can be any, there's
no right or wrong here.

- It's the only time I have
four hours uninterrupted.

I put my phone away and
I just focus on golf.

And it's really good to
have that for anyone else.

Find your golf, so whether it's hiking

or whether it's fishing

or, you know, BMX, motorcycle,

like whatever you can
do that just kinda...

You know who Peter Attia is?

- Yeah.

- He did a, I was at a
YouTube retreat in Montana

with MrBeast and a bunch
of creators and he spoke

and he talked about this a lot.

He's like, "Everyone
needs to find that thing,

activity that can turn your brain off

and you're just focused on a game.

- Yeah.
- Everyone needs that.

And for me, that's golf
and I really have grown

to love it more because of that.

- Yeah.

- You know?
- That's awesome.

- And everyone's like, "You should create

a golf channel," which I did at one point,

and I'm like, "No, then
it's gonna ruin it-

- It ruins it. It ruins it, yep.

- So yeah, I think everybody
should try to find something

that they can do that they don't

even think about their phone.

They don't even think
about texting someone.

They don't think about work.

It could be going for a walk,

but if you go for a walk,

then you're thinking about.

It has to be like.

- An activity,
- A reaction sport.

- Yeah.
- Someone throws a baseball

at you, all you can think
about is catching the baseball.

So whatever thing that would be for you.

- I do woodworking.

- That's great. That's a perfect example.

- You better be in it too

or else you're gonna cut your finger off-

- 'Cause it's a reaction thing.

Like you can't not
think about woodworking.

- Yeah.
- You know?

I think that it's really,
this is really important.

- It is. Yeah
- Totally agree with that-

- It's super important.

I'm really stressed all the time.

My lifestyle, always anxious,
going into war zones,

even though I play it off cool.

I'm still worried at a certain point.

So I gotta find these times

that I can kinda like
chill out a little bit.

- We need to get this guy one of those.

You need a golf or something

- Woodworkin'?

- Yeah. You need to come.
- I hate golf, dude.

- Why don't you come
into the shop with me?

You could be a woodworker.

- I surf, dude.
- You could sand.

I'll teach you how to sand.

I hate sanding.
- Do you like sports

in general?

- Yeah, I mean, I like watching sports,

but I like surfing, I've gotten

into surfing since I moved-
- Surfing's cool.

That's perfect.
- Yeah.

I actually tell people it's like my golf.

- Yeah.

- 'Cause it's just, yeah.

I love getting out on the water.

- That's a perfect thing.

- Just tune out, watch the waves,

try to catch one or two.

- Do you hate golf
'cause it's frustrating?

It's hard to be good

- Dude, the learning curve,
it's deceptively difficult.

It's deceptively difficult.

And it is very long.

It's very, very long.
- I'm grateful that

my dad enrolled me in golf lessons

when I was like 12, so from a young age,

I was able to kinda figure it out.

- You're from Arizona too.
- Yeah, from Arizona.

But yeah, it's really hard.

It's annoyingly hard.

- I tried to pick it up like
maybe six or eight years ago

because it was one of these
things where I'm like,

wow, there's all these
really impressive people

who love to golf.

Like I should learn to golf,

so I can spend time with really-

- It's a good networking-
- Interesting, yeah.

Like, yeah, get face time
with people and, yeah,

I fuckin' hated it.
- Surfing, there's not

too much face time.

You're like, what's up dude, boom.

(group chuckling)

- It can actually, it's a nice,

it's a nice bro hang activity.

So like if you-

- I guess while you're
waiting for the wave.

- Right, 'cause you've got all this time

to kinda just sit in the water together

and you don't have to take a wave.

Like you can-

- Just hang out.
- You can let waves go by.

Like if you're having a good conversation,

you just let waves go by.
- Interesting. Yeah.

I've tried surfing a few times

and I can't stand up on the board, but...

- It's similar to golf in that
it's deceptively difficult.

- I'm pretty coordinated with that stuff.

I just can't figure out surfing.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- It's hard.
- I'll have to try it

in the future.
- It's hard.

I'm still bad at it, but, you know,

I love it.

All right, and then what do
you give too few fucks about?

Apparently hanging out in war zones?

I'm gonna answer that one for you.

- I was gonna say like I
have no like, I can't...

- Your gauge of danger
seems to be a little askew.

- I'm like numb to it.
I'm completely numb to it.

- Yeah, well, I hope you live.

- Me too, thank you.

(group chuckling)

- Drew Binsky, everybody.

(group laughing)

I joke around,

but it is really cool what you're doing

and it is, I mean, honestly,

what you said is 100% true,

which is there are places in the world

where the stories are underserved

and the people are underserved in terms

of having their stories
broadcast to the world.

So like, we need people
like you to go there

and broadcast those stories.

So I am selfishly grateful

for what you do.
- Thank you.

- And what people like you do.

Maybe skip Mogadishu on the
next itinerary. (laughing)

- But next time you head somewhere,

like Budapest or
whatever, just lemme know.

I can give you some advice

or whatever story you're making,

it's probably something I've thought about

or that I can help you with.

- Cool.
- Steer you

in the right direction.

- Appreciate that.
- Yeah, no problem.

- Awesome, man.

(upbeat music)
