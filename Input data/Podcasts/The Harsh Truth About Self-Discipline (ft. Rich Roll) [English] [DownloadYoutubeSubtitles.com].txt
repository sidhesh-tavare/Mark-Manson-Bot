- About a year ago, a thought struck me.

And I haven't really been able to shake it

or come to terms with it since.

And that thought is this.

What if self-discipline is
simply developing addictions

that are good for you?

Like, what's the difference?

If I feel compelled to run
every day to keep myself happy,

and if not running every day
makes me noticeably unhappy,

how is that, psychologically speaking,

any different from needing

to have a drink every day to be happy?

This idea really hit home

for me the past few years
with my health transformation.

For example, I used to have
terrible eating habits.

Many of these poor eating habits

resembled a kind of addiction.

If you put a dessert in
front of me after dinner,

I literally did not know how

to stop the spoon from entering my mouth.

Even if I was in pain, I
couldn't stop eating it.

If I ordered one drink,

it was a given that drinks two, three,

and four would soon follow.

It was simply unconscious.

To not order them was
extremely uncomfortable

and slightly upsetting.

Now, initially, when I
started to undo these habits,

I did what everybody does.

I brute forced it.

I created a plan

and basically tortured
myself until I stuck to it.

But as time went on,

what I noticed was that
it didn't really work,

at least not in the long run.

What I slowly realized
is that eventually I had

to train my body to become addicted

to the things that were good for it.

If I don't eat plenty of vegetables

and whole foods now, I start missing them.

I start feeling worse for not eating them.

If I go more than two or
three days without exercise,

I start to get antsy and
fidgety and irritable

until I can exercise again.

It was in this that I
realized that getting healthy

wasn't so much defeating
my unhealthy demons

so much as converting
them into healthy angels.

I look around at the
other areas of my life

and I notice the same thing.

I'm absolutely addicted to work.

My wife has long known that
when we go on vacation,

I'm gonna be anxious

and irritable the first couple days

until I get over not being able to work.

Now, depending on who you ask,

that means I'm either
prodigiously productive

or I'm a fucking workaholic

who is barely managing his personal life.

Who's to say?

To be honest, both
things are probably true.

I guess what I'm saying is that
over the past couple years,

I'm slowly arriving at the view

that one doesn't necessarily get rid

of addictive or compulsive
behaviors so much as steer them

into healthier addictions and compulsions.

Now, my guest today is the perfect person

to discuss this nuance of our psychology.

Rich Roll is most famous as a podcaster.

In fact, many of you likely
listen to his podcast.

He's one of the most requested
guests that I've gotten.

But before he was a podcaster,

he was an ultra endurance athlete.

He once completed five Iron Man triathlons

on five consecutive days.

I know.

What the fuck.

And more notably,

his entire ultra endurance career occurred

after the age of 40.

But perhaps most interestingly,

Rich is also a recovered alcoholic.

We're talking serious,

wake up and pour yourself a vodka tonic

before breakfast type of alcoholic.

And it wasn't until he got sober

that he developed an interest
in ultra endurance athletics.

Now, Rich and I go deep on this one.

We talk about all sorts of
stuff related to addiction,

but also goals,
productivity, and discipline.

We talk about the relationship

between addiction and dedication,

and if there really is a
difference between the two.

We talk about the need
for extreme experience

and how this has both an outsized positive

and negative results in our lives.

We discussed the 12 step program,

what they get right and
what they might get wrong,

and why they've been so effective

for so many people for over a century now.

We talk about how addiction
is not actually the problem,

but a failed solution to the real problem,

and what that problem might be.

We talk about how to
define a secular version

of spirituality and how it relates

to self-acceptance, forgiveness,
and physical fitness.

We talk about how Rich spent
seven years barely able

to financially support his family

before his career finally took off,

and how he managed his relationships

and stayed motivated through that time.

And finally, Rich shares
with us what he truly does

and doesn't give a fuck about.

All of that and much more.

Now, before we get into the episode,

I have a quick housekeeping
announcement to make.

We are moving the podcast
to its own YouTube channel.

So if you've been watching this

on the Mark Manson channel,

please go over to The Subtle Art

of Not Giving You a F*ck
channel and subscribe there.

Right now, we're posting clips

and shorts from old
episodes on that channel.

But starting in July,

full episodes will only
be posted over there.

So head over.

The link's in the description.

Sign up there.

Make sure you get the new
episodes when they come out.

Now, back to Rich Roll.

Let's get into it.

- [Narrator] Bro, do you even podcast?

Like, bro.

This is "The Subtle Art of
Not Giving a F*ck" podcast

with your host, Mark Manson.

Rich, so good to have you, dude.

- Good to see you.

Thanks for having me, man.

- [Mark] Yeah.
- I'm excited about this.

- Last time I saw you,
we had a conversation.

We didn't get too far into it.

Like ever since I saw you,

I've been like, I wanna
talk about this again.

I asked you a question.

I said, "Is there a connection

between recovered addicts
and ultra athletes?"

Because I'm curious of the connection

between the compulsive
repetitive behavior behind each.

- Yeah, a hundred percent.

There's a huge overlap.

I don't know if there's a direct pipeline

between recovery and
ultra endurance sports-

- To 13 steps.

- Maybe like Elon Musk
create a boring tunnel

in between the two.

There's certainly a correlation there.

And I think it has a lot to do

with the fact that addicts
by their very nature,

and this is just generalizing,
are drawn to extremes.

They're looking for extreme experiences.

And they do that when they're
active in their disease

to quiet the discomfort
that they're experiencing.

They will reach outside of
themselves for a substance

or a behavior or anything
that will medicate them

and ameliorate whatever kind
of pain they're experiencing.

And I think in recovery,

you get tools for how to then treat

that underlying emotional disposition

to live a healthier life.

But the gambling or the
heroin or the alcohol

or, you know, choose your
poison isn't the problem.

That's the solution to the problem.

And when you get sober

and you have to break up
with your best friend,

this thing that you've relied upon to,

you know, to kind of
navigate life for so long,

when that's taken away from you,

you're like this live wire
of emotional confusion.

And the tools that you learn

in recovery are meant to address that,

to create what we call emotional sobriety.

And they allow you to then
live a more balanced life.

But at the core of myself,

and I've learned in recovery,

like I don't speak for everyone,

I can only speak to my own experiences,

is still that allure to kind of step

into extreme experiences

as a way of kind of heightening
your lived experience.

But also I think there's something

that is inherent within many addicts

to be a seeker, you know.

Seeking for answers.

And the addict will seek those answers

in unhealthy ways until they, you know,

crash and burn and have
to find another way.

But that sensibility or that inclination

towards seeking remains.

And I think ultra endurance is a vehicle

for doing that in a healthier way.

I also think that addicts

can leverage ultra endurance sports

to run away from their problems

in the same way that they
use drugs and alcohol.

And so a question that I get
quite frequently is like,

"Well, isn't that just your alcoholism?

Like, you're just using this sport

in the same way that you used alcohol."

And the answer that I
give to that is probably.

You know, there's some truth to that.

I think anybody who says otherwise

isn't really being honest.

There is an escapism, I think,

where you can run away from your problems

because I'm training for this thing.

And then that way,

you don't really have
to deal with your life.

But I also think the other
piece that's important

to understand is that you're
inviting a difficult experience

into your life.

And that's a much harder choice

to make than reaching for the bottle,

which is always the easy choice.

Like, it's hard to put
your running shoes on

when it's cold and rainy
out and get out the door.

What's easy is to do that
thing that you always did

that always ends up with the same result,

which is to get loaded
and like checked out.

So it's not a binary thing.

I think it's a more
nuanced, complicated thing.

But I think that's why
ultra endurance is a magnet

for so many people in recovery.

If you show up at the starting
line of one of these races,

lots of fully tatted dudes
in sleeves, you know.

Like I know you.

(Mark laughing)
- Yeah, yeah.

- A lot of recovering heroin
addicts and things like that.

And I think, you know, it's a way

of indulging that proclivity
towards extremism.

But to do it in a healthier way.

- There's a lot of interesting threads

that I think tie between the two.

One is a relationship with pain.

I think doing something
that is difficult and hurts,

but continuing to do it anyway.

Like, I think, you know, most people,

they get to beer number three or four,

and they're like, "Oh,
I'm starting to feel bad.

I'm gonna stop now."

Similarly, most people get
to mile three or mile four,

and they're like, "This feels bad.

I'm gonna stop now."

And so the the personality type

that keeps going through
both of those things,

I find it really interesting.

Disposition towards pain or discomfort.

So I consider myself both
a failed endurance athlete

and a failed alcoholic.

And it's one of the things-

- A failed alcoholic.

- I drank a lot.

But I just couldn't
quite, you know. (laughs)

- I don't know whether I failed
at alcoholism or succeeded.

(Mark and Drew laughing)

- I think if you're a
successful alcoholic,

does that mean that you are able

to be a functional drinker
for the rest of your life?

Anyway, go ahead.

- Anyway, I don't know what I am.

And we could talk about that later.

I quit drinking a couple years ago.

- And you look a lot better.

You look a lot thinner.

You look trim and fit.
- It's been profound.

- Your skin looks different.

- I'd actually like to talk
about that at some point.

But it has been profound.

I've heard that there's
a high that people get

during the endurance training.

You know, like once you push

through a certain amount of pain,

there's kind of this endorphin
rush that starts happening.

But I'm curious

how you would describe
your relationship to pain.

- I mean, pain has been
my greatest teacher.

And I think from a general perspective,

when you talk about pain

or you want to define
the playing field here,

you have to look at the
motivation behind the pain.

The alcoholic might seek out pain

because there's this fundamental sense

that you're a piece of
shit and you're worthless

and you wanna punish yourself

to, you know, validate the veracity

of that, you know, that idea.

On the flip side, you know,

pain can be this incredibly
powerful master and teacher.

Like, if you're willing

to invite a certain amount
of suffering into your life

and you develop the wherewithal,

the capacity to kind of
see yourself through it

to the other side, that's very empowering.

Like, that can be an act of self-esteem

if your motivation is correct

and you're approaching it from a place

of trying to grow as
opposed to the former,

which I already described.

In my own case, you know, pain is really,

you know, pain's really the only thing

that's ever gotten me
to like, change my ways.

Like I'm a stubborn motherfucker.

And like, I don't really wanna
get out of my comfort zone

and look at my behavior patterns

and my looping thoughts and
all my character defects.

So it's only when they lead me so astray

and have created a sufficient amount

of like angst and negative life outcomes

that I'm finally forced to like,

confront the behavior and make the change.

And that change is being driven by pain.

So pain can be this lever, you know,

if you're present enough with yourself

and have a degree of self-awareness

to understand when certain
things are going awry

and you want to course correct.

Of course, I mean, you
know better than anybody,

the choice is always availability
to do something different.

You don't have to be in
pain to make a change.

I just think there's something wired

into our you know, into
ourselves, into our bodies

and into our minds that make us resistant

to that until we suffered adequately.

- I've heard you talk about the
turning points in your life.

And they come from a great
deal of pain a lot of times.

And I've heard addicts say the same thing,

that they required a lot
of pain in order to change.

What was it about those times though

where you did actually change?

Was it just the requisite amount of pain?

Was it some sort of mix
of pain and perspective

that you had that that led you

to be able to change things around?

Or was it just the pain itself?

I mean, was there anything

that was really coupled
with that pain that-

- Yeah, it's a good question.

I don't know that I have a
super satisfying answer to that.

When I think back on the day

that I finally decided to get
sober and go to treatment,

that morning wasn't dissimilar

from a thousand other mornings
that I woke up hung over.

And it wasn't like there
was an incident the night

before that was a catalyst to that.

For many years, I knew I was an alcoholic.

It wasn't like a mystery.

You know, I knew that at some point,

I was probably gonna have to like,

deal with this problem.

I was just unwilling to.

And I think there is room

for a little bit of mysticism here.

Like that day that I woke up,

suddenly I was blessed
with a level of willingness

that I didn't have before.

Where did that come from?

I don't know.

There's no direct
relationship with any event

that had occurred the day before,

even the day before that.

It was a growing awareness
that this was a problem

that was met with, you know,
a sort of existential angst

that was becoming
increasingly more intense

until one day I was like, I'm done.

- Yeah.
- You know, I'm done.

And I don't know why it was that day.

But I think, you know, to
extrapolate on that point,

it was like this portal opened.

There was a, you know, in the book,

I talk about like a line in the sand.

Like it just this moment
where this is the moment.

And I know if I don't act
now, that moment will pass.

And I don't know when I'll be revisited

with a level of kind of willingness

that I'm experiencing now.

And that was the same
experience that I had when,

you know, I was turning 40 and was fat

and overweight and
sedentary and, you know,

just disgusted with my career path

and very confused about
what to do with myself

that I once again, had
a moment of willingness

that was met with a
sufficient amount of pain

that motivated me to like,
take immediate action

and try to do something different.

But I don't know.

Like, I can't deconstruct
it anymore than that.

- It's an interesting question

because I think people tend to romanticize

or dramaticize those turning moment,

like those turning points and
those rock bottom moments.

And what's interesting about your story

is that you had a number of moments

that probably should
have been, like, you got-

- Oh, sure.

- You got arrested. You had DUIs.

You had a marriage that failed.

Like those are all kind of your
classic rock bottom moments.

But it was interesting that you, you know,

you kind of denied your
way through all those.

And then it was a more quotidian moment

that you're like, oh, I
gotta get my shit together.

And you alluded to the
health decision as well.

Like, it's just kind of,

you wake up one day and
you go up a set of stairs

and you're like, oh my God,
I can't do this, right?

I found that true in my own life as well.

Like, there's like the big major moments

that should have like woken
me up to something don't.

And then it's like a random
Tuesday a month later

that I'm like, oh wait. (laughs)

- Yeah.

- You know, maybe I should quit drinking.

- Yeah, yeah.

The reality is a lot more mundane than,

you know, the narrative

or the story that we can spin from it.

And it is funny 'cause I was reflecting

on this deep last night
as I was going to sleep.

And I was thinking about
the number of times

that I drove under the influence,

starting when I was a teenager.

Like I was, my life was
spared a thousand times over.

You know, and any one

of those incidents should
have been a wake up call,

could have been a wake up call.

On some level, it gets
lodged in your brain.

You know that you're, you know,

not acting in your own best interest.

But it doesn't move the needle.

Like with true addiction and alcoholism,

the denial is so powerful.

And the capacity

to rationalize your
circumstance is profound.

And it takes a lot to get to a place

where that denial starts to fracture

and you begin to see the
reality of your predicament.

And it's not something that you can

will upon another person,

which is why it's so baffling

and heartbreaking to be in a relationship

with someone who's
suffering from addiction.

You know, I talk to a lot
of parents and partners

of people who are in
the throes of addiction.

And, you know, they say, "What do I do?"

And it's like, you can
stage an intervention.

Whether or not that's gonna stick or not?

It usually doesn't because you
can't compel another person

to be willing to raise their hand

and not just ask for help,
but like, receive that help.

It's an internally driven thing

that's very dependent upon

that person's interior circumstances.

And the elevator, you know,
they say, "Oh, you hit bottom."

Like, I had lots of bottoms, you know?

And the day that I got sober
was not the worst day, right?

So when you think you've hit bottom,

there's always another,

the elevator can keep going down.

And when you are an addict in denial,

you're always quick to look around

and identify the people
who are worse than you

and say, "Well, I'm not that guy."

Like, I'm not homeless.

I'm not this. I'm not that.

So I'm okay.

Or if I can wake up and go to a job,

or if I can wake up and go to the gym,

no matter how horrible
I feel, then I'm okay.

And that will, you know,
propel the addiction further

and further and further until
it just becomes so undeniable

and then you're faced with that choice.

- You've talked about
addiction as a spectrum.

Can you describe more of
what you mean by that?

- I think we're in an
interesting moment right now

where I think people are beginning

to understand that addiction
isn't a binary thing,

that it does live on a spectrum.

And I think that's in large
part due to social media

and our relationships with our phones

where we all experience some level

of compulsion or obsessive behavior,

and we're, you know, we
continue to do something

that we know is making us unhappy.

For a long time, addiction was seen

as sort of an on off switch.

Like, you're a heroin addict

who can't pull the needle out of your arm,

or you're the drunk who's, you know,

in the gutter and living
in a tent down on Skid Row.

But the longer I've been
in the world of recovery

and thought about this,

I really do believe that
it is a spectrum condition

that afflicts almost
everybody on some level.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- So you don't have to
be a full-blown alcoholic

or a drug addict to be someone

who has some form of
addiction in your life.

If you're somebody who,

because of your childhood trauma,

always ends up with
the same kind of person

in a dysfunctional relationship

and you repeat that pattern
again and again and again

despite, you know, it being
abusive or what have you,

there is some argument to be made

that there is a piece there

that's if not technically
addiction is related to addiction.

Like, we're compelled by our past,

by, you know, the wiring
that was installed

when we were kids and the
experiences that we had

that end up, you know, dictating a lot

of behavior patterns that move
us in the wrong direction.

And it doesn't take much these days

with technology to override
our dopamine system

and kind of hijack our brains

and compel us to do things
that otherwise we wouldn't,

or that we thought that we,
you know, weren't going to.

And I think it's sort of liberating

to think of it in that context,

that on some level,

we can all relate to
this a little bit better.

And we don't have to think of people

who are truly in the
throes of addiction as,

you know, bad people, but
rather everyday normal people

who have been hijacked
to a more extreme degree

of, you know, what we
can all kind of relate

to in our daily lives.

- I'm curious.

'Cause I've been thinking about this.

Part of it's the alcohol
thing, quitting alcohol.

Struggling with this idea.

Like I feel like I'm in this,

I don't know if I would ever
identify as an alcoholic,

but it was a problem and
I was in denial about it.

But I'm curious.

Like I agree with your take
on addiction as a spectrum.

And I can see many areas of my life

that I act more compulsively
than I would like.

I'm curious.

All three of us,

what are each of us most
addicted to at the moment?

Like, if you had to pick
one thing in your life today

that you feel is like your
most addictive activity.

For me, it's work. I'm a workaholic.

My name's Mark. I'm a workaholic. (laughs)

But I've got, I mean, I've got,
like, I struggle with food.

I struggle.

- But let me ask you this.

When you quit drinking,

did that result in an
increase in workaholism?

- Yes.

- [Rich] Did the intensity of your work?

- Absolutely. Yeah.

- So you have the underlying wound

or whatever it is that
you were medicating.

You remove the alcohol.

But that like beast is still in there

and it's looking for something to feed it.

And so it's gonna reach
for whatever is available

that's gonna give it that,
give you that sense of,

you know, kind of medicating
or distracting you

from whatever those
challenging emotions are

that led you to an unhealthy relationship

with alcohol to begin with.

So I think like excavating
what those emotions are

and then finding a way to address

and ultimately heal them is
where the liberation is found.

But I would share that with you.

If I had to raise my hand right now,

I would say, you know,
workaholism for sure.

- Yeah.
- I work way too much.

And I can distract myself

from discomfort by just plowing into work.

And then my phone, like everyone else.

Like, I'm like, what? You
know, like I know better.

You know, and I continue
to scroll more than I,

you know, more than I like.

And I don't end up reading books

and doing other things that, you know,

I used to do as a result.

- Totally. Drew.

- Work is definitely,

I don't know if I've ever
labeled it as an addiction.

I quit drinking a few years ago too.

And now I'm off social
media for the most part.

I don't really read news.

- Drew has no vices. (laughs)
- Yeah.

- That's not true.

No, that's not true.

Including these vices and
I'm uncovering more too.

I've used work as, I haven't
labeled an addiction,

but I do definitely know it's
a distraction for me for sure.

And it's getting right to that,

what you were just talking about.

You're distracting yourself

from whatever the
underlying issue there was.

I don't know exactly what mine is either

and I'm kind of trying to
figure that out as well.

But I think with,

definitely with quitting
like social media,

news, stuff like that, I
realized how addicted I was

to just that kinda
self-righteous indignation,

feeling moral superiority that I felt.

That kind of thing.
- That's a great one.

That's a new one.
- [Drew] Yeah.

- That's like really a problem.

- Since I've quit all of that,

I've noticed just how,

I just don't have that as much anymore.

But I was definitely
addicted to that for sure.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- I wonder like, 'cause absolutely.

Like there is some
underlying angst or emotion.

There's this, the term
addictive personality.

Like, do you think that
there's just some people

who are just fundamentally more
addiction prone than others?

- I think so.

I think there is a genetic
piece to it for sure.

But I don't think that that
genetic piece is determinative.

- Of course.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Well, this raises another question.

This kind of gets into
the workaholism thing.

It's like, depending what room I'm in,

like if I'm in a room with
like my family and my wife,

I'm a workaholic.

But if I'm at a conference,

I'm an extremely disciplined entrepreneur

who is absolutely crushing it.

- Well, workaholism is
socially validated too.

- Yeah. Yeah.

- You're not a pariah
if you're workaholic.

You're just, you're on
your hustle, you know.

And that gets celebrated.

And that I think becomes, you know,

when you shroud your
addiction in accolades

and, you know, in celebration,

it's a lot harder to
confront it, you know.

- [Mark] Yeah.
- Like you go on the internet

and you talk about how hard you work

and your hustle porn and
all that kind of stuff,

and it's like, that's a way to like,

you know, enhance your social profile

and your status and the like, right?

So, but fundamentally,

it's no different than the addictions

that we frown upon and shun people for.

- Yeah.

Well, it's to bring it
back to the athletics too.

You know, like you hear stories

about Kobe Bryant and Tom Brady and-

- Right.
- And it's-

- Or the Ironman widow.

You know what I mean?

You can use all of these
things to run away.

- Yes.
- It's like,

are you running towards something

or are you running away from something?

- Yeah. How do you know the difference?

- I think the more self-actualized

and internally connected you are,

the more trustworthy your instincts are,

the more reliable your gut is.

And when you do that gut check,

it will kind of tell you where you're at.

But if you're living a reactive life

and you're bouncing around

and there's not a lot
of internal reflection,

I don't think that your instincts

or your gut are really leading you.

They're not trustworthy in the same way.

So you could lie to
yourself with more facility.

- [Mark] Yeah.

- Do you think that
the modern distractions

and these modern addictions are,

really lend themselves to that more?

- Yeah, just imagine.

We all think that we're sentient beings

who are forming, you know,

solid opinions based
upon available evidence.

And we're completely in denial in terms

of the extent to which we're
being constantly manipulated.

I mean, it used to just
be television commercials

and billboards and, you know,

we have an awareness
that we're being sold to.

But now, every single one

of us has our own bespoke newsfeed driven

by an algorithm that knows you better

than you know yourself,

that serves up ads that
are specifically programmed

to get you to buy something,

and an information flow
that affirms your worldview

or stokes your ire in the way
that you were talking about.

And I think we're running this,

I mean, I'm not the first to say this,

this massive social experiment

where we're crafting human beings

who basically are walking
around in a reactive way,

unaware of the vast extent

to which they've been
manipulated for, you know,

whether it's somebody else's
agenda, about actor's agenda,

or just the machinations

of our increasingly
algorithm driven world.

It's not a great thing, you know.

- Yeah, that's what I,

after like quitting news
and stuff like that,

something I came to realize was

that I have deeply held
opinions and beliefs

about places and people I've never seen

or met or been to or anything like that.

And that to me was like a wow.

That was a very big wake up call for me.

- It's interesting.

I don't know if you've
had this experience.

But like, since kind of
exiting the news media cycle,

the media shit storm and
being on the outside,

when I come across
people who are inside it

and really worked up about

whatever issue they're worked up about,

it's very similar to like being sober

and coming across a very drunk person

and being like, wow, I can't
believe I used to be like that.

(Mark laughing)

You know. Like, holy shit.

It's eyeopening for sure.

Like, it's pretty wild.

Okay, yeah.

That was a little aggressive.

But that's why I've
added Momentous creatine,

omega-3s, and protein to my daily regimen.

Let's be honest.

Most supplements kind of suck.

But I like Momentous

Would you say that twelve-step
program saved your life?

- A hundred percent.

- So since you went through
this twelve-step program,

you've started a podcast.

You've interviewed hundreds of people.

You've done all this research,
all this work on yourself.

Read all these books.

Talked to dozens and dozens of experts.

I'm curious.

Has your perspective on the
twelve-step program changed?

And if so, how?

And I'd be curious,

given your knowledge and experience since.

Because the world of psychology

and psychological intervention is just,

it's notorious for
nothing being consistent

or working consistently.

Like other than therapy
and a couple other things,

like nothing has really
stood the test of time,

except for the twelve-step program.

Twelve-step program is one
of the few interventions

that's still around a hundred years later,

still working for people.

So I'm curious just like what
your broader take on it is.

- I'm a staunch defender of twelve-step.

I'm a firm believer in it.

I'm fully indoctrinated in it.

I absolutely believe that
it not only saved my life,

but it continues to save my life.

And I've seen it produce miracles.

Like I've seen it.

I've seen people come in to
the program completely broken

and on like on a surface level,

appear to be utterly unredeemable

with all kinds of mental
issues, et cetera,

where you're just like,

well, that's like a lost cause over there.

And then I've seen them get well

and become not just
productive members of society,

but incredible inspiring
examples of service.

Like I, you know, the level
of service that I see,

selfless service every single day

in the rooms is something I
don't see in my normal life.

It works.

As they say, it works if you work it.

- Yeah.
- And, you know,

AA twelve-step gets a lot of shit.

People who aren't part of
that community are very quick

to dismiss it as this archaic,

you know, relic of a bygone era.

And now, we have science
and we have all these tools.

And I've been around long enough
to see every couple years,

something pops up where it's like,

everything you know
about sobriety is wrong.

And here's our new solution
or our new protocol.

And you don't have to do that bullshit.

And now you can do this.

It's like, okay.

You know, and they just,

they come and they go and
they come and they go.

But you know what persists?

Twelve-step.

And I think the tools that you learn

in this program are tools for life.

Like anybody.

You don't have to be an
addict to benefit from them.

It basically provides you

with this incredible
framework to evaluate your,

not just your behavior and
your character proclivities,

but also your resentments and your fears.

And it's very action-oriented.

It's like, okay, you do this inventory.

And then you identify
patterns in your behavior

that then lead you to
understand, you know,

why you behave a certain
way in a certain context.

And then it compels you to
visit all of these people

that you've wronged over
the course of your life,

or that you've resented,

or, you know, that you've
transgressed in some way.

And you're not meant to
apologize to these people.

You're meant to make an amend,

which means to make it right.

Like you have to correct the past.

And there's something very challenging

about that in confronting,
but also liberating

because you're basically
cleaning up your past.

So all of the guilt and
embarrassment and shame.

You know, shame is like
this driver of, you know,

that keeps people stuck
and small and alone.

When you make those amends

and you kind of embrace a
more spiritual way of life,

there's a liberty to that.

There's an incredible freedom

where your past no longer owns you.

And you have this experience
that you can then share

with other people to be helpful to them.

They say, you know,
like they say in a like,

stick with the winners.

And then the question
is, well, who are the,

how do I know who the winners are?

And the answer is, we take turns.

You know, it's like, you
know, all we have is today.

And doesn't matter how
long you've been sober.

You're still gonna have hard times.

You're still gonna have resentments

and things that come up and challenges.

And so we take turns and
we support each other.

And I don't know any other
kind of community based thing

where you can show up to a
room with a group of people

and have nothing to give,
nothing to contribute,

feel totally alone and broken,

and people will come up to you

and help you and want nothing in return.

Like, it's really a remarkable thing.

And it's persisted not just

because the tools actually
work and improve lives,

but also because of this sort
of distributed responsibility.

Like, there's no boss.

There's no one in charge.

There's no real organization
that's controlling anything.

Like, it's almost as if
they figured out a model

that's allowed it to evolve over time

and stay true to its
roots and its essence.

I feel like Harvard Business School

should do a case study on this.

Like, how is it that it
hasn't been corrupted

or there isn't some leader, you know,

who's, you know,
squirreling away the money

or any of the things that we see

that any organization when
it reaches a certain scale,

ultimately, you know, sows
the seeds of its downfall.

And it's survived because
of this really cool model

where each meeting is independent
of the other meetings.

And there's a loose network.

And there is a home office
and all this sort of stuff.

But everything is volunteer
basis and nobody is in charge.

Just a bunch of lunatic
addicts and alcoholics.

Like the least reliable
people in the world.

You know what I mean?

Like that's irony on top whole thing.

- And it's one of the most
enduring organization.

- Like, it's just a massive
insane asylum, you know?

And there's something
really kind of like amazing

and beautiful about that.

But there was another
part to your question.

How has my relationship with it changed?

- Or has it?
- Or has changed? Yeah.

- Has your views evolved since?

- I think, well, one thing that's changed

is I'm far less judgmental of people

who find sobriety in other ways.

You know, I used to be pretty hardcore.

Like, oh, it only has to be this way.

And now I understand,

I know plenty of people
who have gotten sober

or just decided not to, you
know, use drugs or alcohol

or quit gambling or whatever
in their own unique ways.

And I used to be like,
yeah, we'll see, you know.

Call me in a year and
we'll see how it's going.

But I'm much more open-minded about that.

And I think the other thing

that maybe has changed
is that I don't look

to AA as the only remedy to what ails me.

I'm a big believer in therapy.

I have a men's group that I attend

where I sit down once a
week with like seven guys.

And it's moderated by a therapist.

And that's just about life stuff.

Relationships, like, you know,
stuff I wouldn't take to AA

because it's not really
about my alcoholism,

but I have other problems that
aren't necessarily related

to my alcoholism that I need feedback on.

And then cultivating spiritual
growth in other ways too.

I mean, AA is a spiritual program.

But, you know, in the
meetings, you don't hear a lot

about that other than
we end with meditation.

But fundamentally,

if you read "The Big Book
of Alcoholics Anonymous,"

it is all about like
developing a relationship

with the beyond in your own way.

Like there's no dictates
around what that looks like.

And I think that I've learned to explore

that outside of the
construct of twelve-step.

And that's also been beneficial.

- I got a question about amends,

if we can go back to that real quick.

I always wanted to ask somebody about this

because I think a lot of people do,

outside of addiction even too,

struggle with how to deal with forgiveness

and everything like that.

When you do go back,

I'm sure that it's a
very healing experience

to go back and make amends with people.

And when they accept it, it's great.

- Sometimes. Not always.

- [Drew] Oh, yeah. Right.

- [Rich] Doesn't always go well.

- We can talk about that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Go Ahead. Sorry.

- But also, I think there's probably

more valuable experience from the people

who don't accept that from you, right?

Who reject your amends making or reject,

who don't forgive you.

What's that experience like, I guess.

Because I'm sure there
were people like that who,

you know, didn't accept
your pleas for amends.

- Yeah, and that's fine.
- Yeah.

- That's fine.

The amend isn't necessarily for them.

It's for you to liberate yourself

from your emotional
ties to that experience.

And it's not always gonna go well.

And in certain cases,

it's not even appropriate

to make a direct amend to that person.

Because the rule is, you know,

you're there to like, heal a situation.

And if it's so broken or the
relationship is so problematic

and you know that
approaching them directly

isn't gonna go well and
it might harm that person

or upset them in a way
that's really not kind

or in service to that person,

then the amend has to be a living amend.

Like whatever behavior, you know,

however you contributed
to that unhealthy dynamic,

the amend is to not engage in

that behavior anymore
going forward, right?

So, and that, I think that comes up a lot

with sexual relationships

and the sexual inventory that you do.

Like, it's not appropriate to go back

to some person that you cheated
on or harmed in some way,

and like just, you know,

where you had an unhealthy
kind of dynamic with them.

Like, they don't wanna hear from you.

- Yeah, reopen that wound.

- You know, it's, yeah.

It's like you're disrupting
their life to do that.

So it's like, okay, you
can write a letter maybe,

or, you know, better yet,

maybe you just don't do
that behavior anymore.

- Speaking of cheating exes.

(Mark laughing)

- Oh, dude.

- How do you like that segue? (laughs)

I was really blown away

by this passage in your
book for listeners.

You had an almost marriage.

Basically, you broke up on the honeymoon.

But I was blown away.

And we can cover that if you want.

But you wrote here,
"I've come to appreciate

that great beauty lies in destruction.

Looking back, it is
undeniable that the wedding

that nearly destroyed me
was absolutely crucial

in precipitating my ultimate salvation.

And for this, I am and will
always be eternally grateful."

I get a lot of emails from people

with horrible breakups, cheating partners,

failed marriages, people
full of resentment,

full of rage, confusion, anger.

And I feel like that paragraph is,

if you could get,

if I could snap my finger
and get everybody to a spot,

like that's the spot
you want them to get at.

I'm curious, A, like how long
of a process was that for you?

And B, what did that process look like?

- It was a long process.

It took me, I mean, I was out of my skull

when that was going on.

And that really was my bottom, you know?

And it was so painful that I had to drink.

There's no way I could've
immediately gotten sober.

I was so emotionally distraught

in the wake of that experience

that I felt I had no choice
other than to medicate myself

until I got to a point, you know,

where I hit that bottom
and decided to get sober.

It's the most painful thing
that I've ever gone through.

So I got to that place
through time, of course.

You know, you can't make that assessment

when you're in the heat
of that experience.

It's only with perspective.

And perspective requires patience and time

and then doing, you know,
huge amount of work.

And that work involved
therapy and also twelve-step.

And it was very much focused
on identifying my behavior

and completely taking
her behavior out of it.

We like to point fingers and be a victim

and say, "They did this and
they did this and they did this

and these are all the
reasons why I'm suffering."

But really, all that does
is create more suffering,

more victimhood, more blame,

and it doesn't really solve the problem

or move you forward or out of it.

For me, the way through was
to just get super honest

and clear with how I,

not only participated in that dynamic,

but helped to create it.

Like these things,
relationships don't happen

because one person did something to you.

There's always somebody
who created a scenario

in which it made it possible

for that person to make that choice

that you're so upset about.

So all you can do is do an inventory

of what that behavior
is and try to correct it

and try to understand, you know,

why you created that situation.

And then, you know, on a macro level,

to really believe that things
aren't happening to you.

They're happening for you.

And these difficult
experiences that we have,

it goes back to the
conversation around pain.

When bad things happen, it
is an opportunity for growth.

And I think we're here to grow.

And our job is to identify
the growth opportunity

in those challenging moments
and in those obstacles.

And no one wants to hear
that when they're in it.

You know what I mean?
- Easy for you to say.

- I certainly did it.

You know, I'm not here

to tell you I'm like
some kind of master here.

I was a fucking wreck, you know.

And I acted poorly.

And I did a lot to contribute

to this very painful situation
that I had to go through.

And I'm grateful for it
because it gave me clarity

on how I was living my life

and set in motion a trajectory for how

to create a better life for myself.

And I think when I look back on it now,

it's like, thank God that happened.

Thank God that happened.

You know, had that not happened,

I don't know that I would be sitting here,

having this conversation with you.

And I live an amazing life now.

And all of these painful experiences

are not just stops along the
way, you know, guideposts,

but they're my greatest teachers.

And if you can develop the objectivity

and the groundedness and the wherewithal

to look at them and say,

"What can I learn from this experience

and how can I change and grow,"

I think that's the way that you, you know,

kind of elevate beyond those experiences

and create new experiences for yourself

that are better for you.

- So what would you say to
somebody in that moment?

Because it's, like you said,

nobody wants to hear that in the moment.

- I know. I know. I know. Yeah.

(Mark laughing)

I mean, I'm not a therapist.

I'm trying to think.

Like, the thing that I would say is like,

do an inventory on your behavior.

Like, I want to write
down every single way

in which you, you know, created,

your behaviors contributed
to this happening.

And just own that for yourself.

Like take ownership over.

You can't control what
another person is gonna do

or how they're gonna behave.

That's part of what makes us insane

because we wish that we could

or we dilute ourselves into
thinking that we can do that.

All you can do is
control your own behavior

and your reaction or your
response to external events.

And when you develop
some capacity over that,

that's where you begin to
have agency over your life.

And I think the rage and
the upset part of that,

I think derives from a lack
of agency, that victimhood.

Like somebody did that
to me and it was wrong.

Like there's a justice piece there too.

Like, this is unjust. It's unfair.

And you want everybody to know just

how unfairly you've been treated.

But what are you gonna do with that?

How is that informing how
you're moving forward?

The only thing that's gonna help you

take a better step forward

is to really redress your own behavior

and the ways in which you co-created

that suboptimal situation for yourself.

- You can either be right or be happy.

- Right. Yeah, yeah.

- Would you say that some of that,

it's almost like transmuting
those painful experiences

into growth.

'Cause you've mentioned now a few times

in the conversation spirituality.

The primary question is like,

how do you see spirituality

and then do you see that
as being part of it?

- Yeah, spirituality is
definitely part of it.

I get asked a lot like how
do I define spirituality.

I never have a good answer to this.

I should really work on it.

- Does anyone have a good-

- I wish I have some really pithy,

like, cool way of answering this.

I mean, it's definitely something

that has nothing to do
with any religious dogma.

I just believe in the
ways in which the mystical

beyond is working in our lives for us.

And all I have to do is
reflect on my own life

and all the thousands
of ways in which like,

I feel like I've been taken care of

or spared from disaster or, you know,

the bad decisions that I've
made in the course of my life.

And there's just no way,

like, I'm very clear on the fact

that the life that I
live today, which I love

and is beyond anything I
could have ever imagined

for myself, has anything to do

with like my planning or my self will.

It just doesn't.

It unfolded organically as a direct result

of investing in myself and
trying to be a better human,

a human who operates from a
greater place of integrity

by being of service to other people.

Like the more I'm of
service to someone else

and I get out of my own
head and my self obsession

and my ego, which is
like a problem, you know?

Like, it's not like,
you know, it's not like,

I'm not, I don't wake up grateful

and looking forward to
like helping other people.

I wanna do what I want to do.

I want be a workaholic and I want to like,

just basically caress my ego

and, you know, all that kinda shit, right?

But when I get out of myself

and I extend myself selflessly to others,

my life gets better and magical.

Amazing things tend to,

and the problems that seem overwhelming

somehow seem to get solved.

And I have no explanation for that.

And I think that provides space for me

to cultivate a little awe
and wonder and humility also.

We think we know what's going on.

I mean, we're like on
this rock spinning around

and we're in space and we're
like, yeah, I understand that.

Like, are you fucking kidding me?

Like, do we?

We don't actually know what's going on.

And the more you look into science

at the subatomic particle
level all the way to the,

you know, dark matter, dark energy,

you know, expanding universe level,

the more insane it is.

And so I think the idea
that we think we understand

what's happening is our ego.

And I think to just appreciate

that maybe we're missing that extra lobe

in our brain that would allow us

to see things more clearly
provides an opening

for me to have an
appreciation for the beyond.

And it allows me to transcend
the wily ways of the ego.

- Yeah, and I think you talked too

about we're always in a
constant state of flux.

It's not a static life that we live,

or even a universe that we're in,

and getting to that all the way

from the subatomic all the way up

to the cosmic level and how we,

but we fight against that so much.

We think things are static so many times

where if we just did this,
then this would happen.

I think there's a very
spiritual component to that too.

The older I get, the
more I see that as well.

It's just like, you're not in control.

- Yeah.

- You're very, very much not in control.

- You're not in control.

And yeah, people are the way they are.

And this is the way things are.

- [Drew] Right, and
it's like everything is-

- Yeah, to the sub-atomic.

Everything's vibrating.

There's nothing that's ever still, ever.

So nothing is constant other than change.

Change is what's constant.

We're always changing.

We're always evolving.

We're always regressing.

We're always doing all of these things.

And we walk around under this delusion

that things are the way they are.

- Yeah.

- And I think, again, like to like hone in

on that is another way

of like cultivating a little,

much needed humility.

- What would you say too is like the,

you know, in your ultra training

and everything like that,
what's the relationship

between the physical
and the spiritual there?

You kind of, you
mentioned it at the outset

about kind of testing yourself

and pushing yourself, getting at the edge.

What's that connection for you

between kind of the more extreme
physical things you've done

and a spirituality that
you've found in it?

Because I've always
been fascinated by that.

I've been on that path too.
- It's a great question.

I mean, to me, it's all spiritual.

Like the physical was just a vehicle

for connecting with
something more spiritual.

And I think had I had the
opportunity to do it again,

I don't know that I would put a picture

of me running on the cover of this book.

(Drew and Rich laughing)

Like, I think, you know. (laughs)

- God damn. Look at that.

Look. That physique.

- Yeah, but I think the mistake

that gets made is that
people think it's a book

about running when, and on
some level, I guess it is.

But the point that I was trying to make

is like my immersion into the world

of ultra endurance and
training for these races

and participating in them was far less

about becoming this competitive
athlete in my mid forties

and much more about, you know,

a sort of more relatable journey

that we all go on to try
to discover who we are

and what we're, you know,
who we're meant to be

and trying to find a way
to live more authentically.

In my case, I used, I didn't even,

it was an unconscious thing.

Like I started doing this thing,

running and riding my bike long distances

because I was in so much existential angst

about how I was living

and I didn't know how to change my life.

And I needed all of that
time alone by myself

in that state of, you
know, kind of low grade,

but elevated exertion where
it's just your breath.

There's something, you know,

kind of actively meditative about that

that allowed me to just feel connected

to my body in a very tactile way

and the space and the
time to really wrestle

with these questions and figure out

who it was that I wanted to be.

So again, like sport was
a vehicle for this for me.

And for somebody else,

it could be something entirely different.

It was really meant as a
metaphor as much as anything else

for the exploration I think we all go on

at some point in our lives,

whether foisted upon us through crisis

or just by circumstances in our lives

where we turn inward,
you know, for answers

because we realize we've been
living our life on autopilot,

or, you know, on the wishes of our parents

or social pressures or what have you.

And we need to find, you know,

we need to find meaning
and purpose for ourselves.

- So as a failed endurance. (laughs)

- Why do you keep saying that though?

There's no failure at running.

- I'm saying that tongue in cheek

'cause podcast listeners know

that I started training for a marathon

at the beginning of this year.

And I was really good up
to like 10 or 12 miles.

- Yeah.
- And then-

- But this is part of the process.

- You've not failed.
- I was like, fuck this shit.

I was like, fuck this shit.

- Don't deny yourself your process, Mark.

- You don't have to be
an endurance athlete.

- I'm joking. I'm totally joking.

But I really am curious because it's,

like running for two to three hours

is incredibly uncomfortable,
even at a slow pace.

And what surprised me about it was like,

it wasn't physically hard
in the way that like,

say, trying to run like a
six minute mile is hard.

Like that's just absolutely,

there's like an intensity
to that exertion.

The endurance stuff was like,

it was like this low level throbbing.

It's just like pure, how
long can you stand this?

And apparently, I can't stand it

for more than a couple hours.

'Cause I was like, fuck this shit.

I'm done.

But I'm curious because, you know,

so I have a, my cousin is,

she's run like six or eight marathons.

She's training for I think
like a 50 miler this year.

And I talked to her about it.

And she was like, "Oh, man.

That's like, that's where
it starts to get good."

Like she didn't understand
what I was talking about.

So I was like, "Okay, maybe
we're just wired differently."

But I'm curious like,

that like low level kind
of just throbbing pain

that kicks in after a couple hours.

Like how do you experience that?

Because my experience of it was just like,

wow, I'd give anything to be

in a swimming pool with an
iced tea right now. (laughs)

- Yeah.

But that is where it gets good.

- Yeah.

- Because that's that point

where you're forced to
really confront yourself.

- Yeah.
- And what you're made of.

And I love it.

Like I seek it out.

I'm always searching for that.

But I also think if you are
actually training properly,

you can get to the point
where you can be in

that zone two state of exertion

and you'll be able to go longer

and it isn't so uncomfortable

that you feel like you have to quit.

Like it can become an enjoyable thing.

And for me, like I look forward to it.

Like, I like train, it's
like the highlight of my day.

And I'm not, like I was
training like a lunatic then.

I'm not doing that now.

And part of me misses it.

Part of me doesn't.

I feel like I've learned what I needed

to learn from those experiences.

But there's something interesting

that happens in your
relationship with time.

Like, I would go out for
these like 10 hour bike rides.

And I'm in that like, state of like,

at the edge of what you
think you can maintain

for that period of time
in terms of exertion.

But you work up towards it.

Like Laird Hamilton doesn't drop in

on an 80 foot wave like overnight.

Like you build up to it very slowly.

And so over a period
of, you know, two years,

getting to the point where
like just inching towards that

so that it feels normal
and you're used to it.

I got to the point

where I felt like I could
wake up every morning

and run a marathon like before breakfast

and then go about my day.

Like, you get so efficient
at this one form of movement

that you're not experiencing
the level of discomfort

that someone like you is experiencing.

It's a different thing.

And time starts to bend.

So like, oh, I only have
an eight hour ride today.

And then you're doing it and you're like,

oh, I only have two hours more.

That's like watching a movie.

That's like, no problem
and then it's over.

And you're like, wow, I was out all day.

I couldn't do that immediately.

Like you build up to it.

- Yeah. Yeah.

- And then it just becomes
like this thing that you do.

- Does your perception of
time like slow down, speed up?

Like does that eight
hours feel like an hour?

Does it-
- Yeah.

The eight hours, I mean, it
doesn't feel like an hour.

But it doesn't feel like eight hours

or it doesn't feel like if you went

from nothing to eight hours

would feel like an eternity, right?

So it feels just like
something that's very doable.

- I think to your point though too,

you said not everybody obviously needs

to be an ultra athlete, right?

An endurance athlete.

But I think people do, you have to choose,

you have to find something
that's really fucking hard.

- Yeah, you have to put yourself

in an uncomfortable situation

where you're forced to meet yourself

somewhere you're reluctant to go.

And that becomes its own form
of teacher to you, right?

And this is how we grow and evolve.

If you don't have,

if you're so reluctant to put yourself

in difficult situations,

then how are you ever
gonna, you know, evolve?

And I think at the same time,

we can get stuck in ruts with this.

So in the context of endurance sports,

like I could just keep doing these races

and keep training for them.

And again, then I would be
running away from something.

And also, you know, I would be celebrated.

Like, oh, you run so far or whatever.

But like, it's not hard anymore.

Like, it's actually
not that uncomfortable.

It's like easy. And it's
kind of what I prefer to do.

- It becomes the new,
it's the new comfort zone.

- It's a new comfort.
- Yeah.

- You know, what's really
uncomfortable is like,

do like, going to therapy and like talking

about shit you don't want to talk about.

Like, that's way more
uncomfortable than going out

and doing that long run that
you can go on social media

and everyone will applaud you for.

So you have to always be seeking out,

like once something that was uncomfortable

is no longer uncomfortable,

like what's the next
horizon for your growth?

- I get that.

I got that way with books and writing.

Like, it felt like,

I mean, I'm sure I'll write
another book at some point.

But the publishing world just kept putting

like another fat carrot.

And by carrot, I mean big check

in front of me over and over again.

And it was like, I could do
this until the day I die.

But at a certain point,

I'm just gonna feel like
I'm repeating myself.

I'm just, you know, going
through the motions.

Like I'm not challenging
myself creatively.

I'm not pushing my career into somewhere

that's uncomfortable and unconventional.

And so then it wouldn't be exciting to me.

Like, it wouldn't be interesting.

I wouldn't have to learn and grow

and fuck up and get better at something.

- Figure out how to put fuck in the title.

- Yeah, I mean, at some point,

there's only so many book
titles you could make with fuck.

- Is that still going on still?

Are people still milking that

in terms of like book titles?

- It slowed down.

But they still show up here and there.

- Yeah.

- Imitation is the highest
form of flattery. (laughs)

- Unless you were to write, you know,

like really push your writing, you know,

into an uncomfortable place so that it

becomes a very uncomfortable
new challenge for you.

- I would, yes.

I hit a point where I kind of realized,

either I do a novel,

which I think nobody in the
publishing world wanted me to do

or come back to internet
land and try video

and podcasting and some
of this other stuff.

I just felt like in kind

of the typical self-help nonfiction lane,

it's like, I need to go live
more to have more stuff to say.

- [Rich] Sure.

- Like, you can't just sit there

and keep playing the
hits over and over again.

Like nobody likes that.

- Yeah, I hear that.

I'm writing a book this year.

And I haven't written a
book since "Finding Ultra,"

which was like 12 years ago.

- [Rich] Oh, yeah?
- So yeah.

- What's it about?

- I promised myself I wouldn't say.

Yeah, yeah.
- I get it. I get it.

- But it's very confronting.

- How's it going?

- It's a very different kind of book.

- Yeah.

- And it is based on lived experience

over the last 12 years.

And, yeah, it's not easy, man.

- No. (laughs)
- It's really not easy.

And the joke that I always tell is,

I do think that I'm a pretty good writer.

Like in all of the skills that I have,

I think like, you know,
it's one of the better ones.

But it's the thing that I do the least.

And the joke that I always tell is like,

I created the podcast as
like the ultimate distraction

from not having to write another book.

And I'm now on year 11,
you know, of running away.

And now, it's finally caught up to me.

And I'm excited about it.

But I forgot how hard it is.

And also, my life is so much busier.

And like when I wrote "Finding Ultra,"

I had nothing going on.

And I worked on it,
you know, all the time.

And now, like carving out the time.

- It's funny.

I had a friend who's an author.

And she told me once,

I mean, obviously, I've
never been pregnant.

But she explained this once.

And I thought it was
like the perfect analogy

for writing a book.

And she said that writing a
book is like being pregnant.

Like as soon as the last one comes out,

you forget how difficult it was

because it's like nature's way

of deluding you into doing it again.

And then as soon as
you get pregnant again,

you're like, oh my God, this is awful.

Why did I do this? (laughs)

But then, you know, you
fall in love with it.

And it's just like this
process of like both suffering

and deep passionate emotion and love.

And then it comes out and
you're exhausted and destroyed

and then you immediately
forget how difficult it was

and you wanna do another one.
- Yeah.

But I would also imagine like the,

it's the most kind of fulfilling,

like meaningful thing that you could do.

- I think in terms of,

like in terms of creative output

that I've done in my career,

there's something just very special

about the packaging of a book,

the cultural significance, the longevity.

Like, I mean, books have been around

for thousands of years, right?

So there is something
very special about it.

And there's a staying power to it

that you don't get with other formats.

- Yeah, we're sitting
here having a podcast.

And you have this book on the table

that I wrote 12 years ago.

You still wanna talk about this?

- Yeah. (laughs)

- Like, you know, I've done
a lot of things since then.

- Yeah.
- But, yeah.

It speaks to the, you know,

the sort of permanence of books

that is different than
every other form of media.

- Yeah.
- Even movies.

Like, okay, "Fall Guy" came out recently.

It bombed.

And then 18 days later, you can stream it.

- Well, I mean-

- Our relationship with media.

Everything is disposable.

- Yes.

So I did a movie three years ago.

Or it came out three years ago.

Or no, I did it three years ago.

It came out a year and a half ago.

And it was funny because out

of anything I've done in my career,

I got more messages from
people I went to high school

and college with than
anything else I've ever done.

Like, even when I was number
one in New York Times,

I was like, on "The Today
Show," like all that stuff.

Never heard from people.

But the movie comes out
and suddenly it's like,

you know, Joe Schmo that I haven't talked

to since 11th grade is like,

you know, hitting me up on Facebook.

So that was interesting.

But then a month later, it
was like nothing happened.

It was like, it was completely gone.

But I want to get back to,

well, the things that
you've done since the book.

You briefly mentioned
at the end of the book

that you quit your job.

I guess this was a year
before the podcast started.

You mentioned that it

was like incredibly
agonizing and terrifying.

I mean, you had a day job.

You had kids.

Obviously, there's like
financial instability.

But you didn't go into
any detail about it.

And I thought that was interesting

because that is another one
of these turning points.

It's a different turning point.

It's different than hitting bottom

with the alcoholism or
the health transition.

But it's another transition.

And it's another moment.

It's kind of in a different direction.

- Yeah, I mean that is a
whole other kind of saga

that I don't think there was room enough

in this book to elaborate
on in too much detail,

but as difficult as any
kind of transformation

that I've undergone and, you know,

it didn't happen quickly or overnight

and it wasn't a switch
getting flipped of like,

I'm quitting my job and
I'm doing this new thing.

I had slowly, like I'd
left big corporate law life

and then continued to practice law,

like as a solo practitioner.

And then I had two partners,
and then I was solo again,

and then I had one partner.

But all the while, kind of slowly receding

into the background like Homer Simpson

into the bushes, you know.

(Mark laughing)

And not really making any money.

So it wasn't like this, you know,

like this, you know, significant
commercial enterprise.

Like I was training and doing these races

and losing interest in practicing law.

And not for nothing.

Like all my client,

I was practicing
entertainment law at the time

and I loved working with
independent filmmakers,

and I felt it was the one thing

in the law that I found fulfilling

'cause I was working with artists

and we were trying to build something.

And I felt like I was part
of the team in doing that.

The problem is they're all broke.

And when they finally get money,

I'm the last person they want to pay.

And so, you know, I had
so many unpaid invoices.

And I had great experiences.

And I got to help make
some really cool movies

and work with really
creative, interesting people

in this shadow artist capacity.

Like wanting to always
be the creative person,

but being, you know, the person

behind the scenes who
has like the safe job.

Ironically, I was the one

who's getting paid the least
'cause I never got paid.

So it wasn't like, oh,
I'm quitting this job

that's paying all my bills.

Like I wasn't paying all the bills.

I was barely making ends meet.

This book comes out.

And it does fine.

It doesn't make the New
York Times bestseller list.

I got what I thought was like
an incredibly generous advance

for somebody who'd never written a book

and really didn't have a
social profile at the time.

But as you know, like those
payments are meted out

in small chunks over an
incredibly long period of time.

And I have four kids and a mortgage.

And like, it was,

this was not like
sustaining me is my point.

When the book came out, that
was, in a ceremonious way,

like, okay, I'm not
renewing my bar membership

so I can't practice law.

I was like cutting that cord.

But on a day-to-day basis,

things didn't look all that different.

And I think it speaks to the
question around spirituality

because I have this faith and this trust.

Like I'm gonna totally commit

to just figuring out a
new way of making a living

and supporting my family based

upon these ideas that I've shared

and a trust that somehow like
there's a solution for this.

And now, it seems a little more clear.

There's like all these influencers

and we see how they make money
and all this sort of thing.

Like in 2012, like that wasn't so clear.

There weren't other people
doing this kind of thing.

- No.
- There was no blueprint

or roadmap for how to, you know, get paid.

And I just said, "You know,
well, the phone's gonna ring.

And I'll get, you know,
asked to do some speaking.

And one thing's gonna lead to another."

But the phone didn't really ring.

Like I had a moment with this coming out.

And then that was that.

And I was just sort of waiting passively

for something to happen

and feeling like I didn't have agency

and wasn't sure what to do to
kind of move the ball forward.

And it was very, very
difficult for a long time.

Like seven years.
- Wow.

- Of real financial challenges.

We came within 48 hours
of losing our house.

We had cars repossessed.
- Wow.

- I've told this story before.

But I couldn't scrounge up the 80 bucks

to pay waste management

so they took away our trash bins.

And we had this shitty like Honda minivan

that had like 200,000 miles in it

and we would put our garbage in the back

and like drive to behind the grocery store

to put 'em in the, you know, bins.

And our washer and dryer didn't work.

We were going to the laundromat.

And you've been to my house.

Like I live in a beautiful home, right?

So we were like either
the richest poor people

or the poorest rich people.

- I never would have guessed (laughs)

- We were like squatters.

We were like squatters in
our own house, you know?

And it was incredibly
emasculating, you know,

to be, you know, the, you
know, the dad and the husband

and feel like I wasn't able
to solve this equation.

And there were many times

where I was like, this is ridiculous.

And I would tell my wife, like,

"I can just make some
calls and go back into law.

I can probably get a job at a law firm."

Like it's too painful.

It's not working.

You know, whatever plan we had,

like clearly this isn't what
I'm supposed to be doing.

And it was really my wife's conviction

and her, you know, kind of very devoted,

you know, spiritual
perspective that, you know,

we were on this path that
we were meant to be on

that kept me anchored in it.

She was like, "We've come too far."

Like she knew who I was before.

She knew who I was then.

She's like, "This is who
you're supposed to be.

Like, I don't know how these
questions get answered,

but the only way they get
answered is we keep moving forward

in this direction and you cannot retreat."

And I mean, who does that?

You know, who does that?

Like, she's incredible.

And without that support
and that strength,

like I, you know, I don't
know that I would've made it.

And she was like, "Look, it's a house.

It's whatever. Like, who cares, you know.

We're together and our
marriage was made stronger."

- [Mark] Wow.

- In a heightened circumstance

that I think would've
blown up most marriages.

- Yeah.

- And we had to find a way to like,

have fun and turn it into like a game.

You know, like they can take the car away,

but they can't take our dignity away.

Like, that's the choice that we have.

And there was a moment when
the repo guy came to the house.

I had a orange Land Rover
Discovery that I loved.

It was like this cool truck.

I just couldn't make
that $230 payment on it

or whatever for a couple months.

And the guy shows up to take it away.

And Julie goes out into the driveway.

And she's like, "Hey, how are you?"

Like, she introduces herself.

"Hey, do you want a cup of tea?

You want to come inside? Do
you need to use the bathroom?"

Like, treated this man with
kindness and generosity.

And he was like shocked, you know,

because he's just used
to people throwing stuff

at him and screaming at him.

And he's like, what's happening?

- Yeah.
- She's like,

he's like, "You know I'm
here to take the car, right?"

- She's like, "Oh, yeah.
I know. It's great.

Like, let me get you the
keys and I'll get you done.

Do you need anything else?"

And that was like a masterclass

in how to handle a circumstance like that

with just extreme
equanimity and neutrality.

And she would always say,

and she still says like,
"Neutrality is a superpower."

Like these things are all happening

and they're swirling around us.

And to your point around control,

like we don't have control over them.

We only have control in the
way that we respond to them.

And if you can meet
these challenging moments

with extreme neutrality,

then you can navigate them with dignity.

And you're also in the frame of mind

to make better decisions

because you're not being
impulsed emotionally by them

that makes you reactive.

And, you know, as we all know,

like those generally
lead to bad decisions.

- Damn, dude.

Bring your wife in here.

- I was just gonna say.

- We're done with you.

You can leave now.

- She's the better podcast guest.

Trust me.

She comes in like, and she'll
like do her own podcast.

And she'll just sit down and solo it,

you know, like for like an hour

and a half and just drop wisdom.

I'm like, "How do you do that?"

Like, I don't know how you do that.

- [Mark] That's super cool.
- She's amazing.

And, yeah.

I'm very clear on how important
and fundamental she's been

to like this whole journey that I'm on.

Like left to my own devices, like no way.

- And I imagine that belief in you

like extended prior to
that as well, like with...

- Well, she would say like,

she was always able to see
like the better version of me.

Not in the way that like,

oh, you're in a relationship
and they want to change you.

Like, she never wanted to,

she never tried to change me.

She was like, "I see who you really are."

And she would hold my hand.

And she was somebody

who lived her life very
differently than me.

Like I grew up in a,
you know, achievement,

educated, focused
household where, you know,

traditional ideas around success
were what were important,

and, you know, using your
intellectual capacities

to make sense of the world.

Like, this is how you operate.

I grew up in Washington, DC.

It's like, this is, it's
very like structured

how you kind of move up in society.

That's the way I was programmed.

My wife, she is an artist.

And she's doing 10 things at once.

And she doesn't operate like that at all.

And she has a different
relationship with risk,

all these things, which
to me was fascinating.

I've never met anyone like that.

And it was her like saying,

"Take my hand and come over here

and let me show you, you know, my ways"

that gave me a sense of possibility

and a different lens on which to,

you know, kind of reflect on my life

and the possibilities
for what it might be.

- So when did the podcast start?

Was that just something you
threw at the wall or was-

- Kind of, yeah.

So I started it in late 2012-

- Which is super early in podcast game.

- Pretty early.

Yeah, so what happened
was the book came out

in spring of 2012 and I did
everything to push that out.

And then in the wake of
that, it's a longer story,

but there was a creative vacuum.

It's sort of like, well, what do I do now

or how can I continue this conversation

that I've begun with this book

or where do I place my
energy and my attention?

And podcasting was the decision I made.

And, yes. It was very early.

I wasn't like the first,

but it was definitely a time

in which it wasn't cool
to start a podcast.

And people weren't
clamoring to start podcasts.

But I'd fallen in love with the medium

in like 2007, beginning 2007, 2008

when I started training
for all of these events,

and I would have to spend
all this time alone,

and I needed something to distract me

from the misery and the
suffering and the pain.

And I could just listen to music.

And, you know, yeah, I
would listen to audiobooks.

But I didn't have any money either.

And that's when I discovered podcasts.

And it was a time in which you had

to go to iTunes on your desktop

and you had to select the podcasts

that you wanted to download,

download them, and then
bounce them to like an iPod.

There were no podcast apps

and things like that that we have now.

The technology hadn't been sorted out.

And I discovered like a whole world.

Even though there weren't as like,

certainly not as many
podcasts as there are now,

there was enough to amaze me.

And I thought, oh my God.

I can't believe like you
can listen to these people

and they talk about like, you know,

these successful people
and they tell you exactly

what they did and how they live their life

to get to this place and this is free?

Like, I was just astounded.

And I didn't know one single other person

that was listening to
podcasts at the time,

other than myself. But
I just knew I loved it.

And so I listened to
probably thousands of hours.

So I'd consumed a huge
amount of podcast content

when I made that decision.

Like, hey, this is cool.

I know some interesting people.

And doesn't look like
there's a lot happening

in the kind of health and
wellbeing fitness space

on podcasts so let's just give it a try.

And my wife and I sat down.

And we were living in
these yurts in Kauai.

It's a whole other long story.

It's like, yeah.

(Mark and Drew laughing)

It's like we thought we
were losing our house.

And I got like this job opportunity

on the north shore of Kauai

with a guy who owned a big property there.

And for some reason, he thought

that I could help him figure out

how to develop this property.

But it was lifesaving.

'Cause he is like, I'll pay you.

- Yeah.
- And nobody else was offering

to pay me anything and I was broke.

The hitch was, we had to move to Kauai

and we had to live on this farm.

And he had this like yurt village.

So we were literally living in Yurts

and thinking, our house was
getting taken away from us.

This is our new home, you know.

Little kids.

And I was starting to, and it was great.

It was also hard.

And I was starting to experience
a little island fever.

And I was like, I wrote this book

and I was doing all these things

to try to make something happen.

And now, I'm like in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean on,

you know, this island where
there isn't very much going on.

And I felt that was the
urgency around like,

trying to create something
or take some action.

And my boys who are musicians,

they had microphones and some equipment.

And I spent like a day
trying to figure out like

how you like get a podcast on iTunes.

And you know who Pat Flynn,

like the smart passive income guy?

- Yeah.

- He had made like a series of videos

where he is like here's
exactly how to do it.

Here's the equipment you need.

Step by step.

Like basically a to-do list.

And I watched all those videos.
I took notes and I was like,

okay, I think I can figure this out.

And I did it. And then I was
like, okay, let's record one.

And I sat down with,

my wife and I sat down in a warehouse.

Not a good place to host a podcast.

Tin ceiling, and like, yeah.

Like, let's do it here, you know.

(Mark laughing)

And we just recorded an episode.

And at the end of it I was
like, that was pretty fun.

Like, do you want to do it tomorrow?

Like, that was it.

It wasn't like, here's my plan

and we're gonna launch this thing.

And it just organically evolved

from a creative impulse into reality.

And what was very unique and different

about that time was the fact
that there was no competition.

Like people were not starting pods.

So I think our first
episodes got, I don't know,

like 750 downloads, a thousand
or something like that.

And it kind of went like
straight to number one in health.

- Wow.
- Yeah, so.

- A thousand.

(Mark and Drew laughing)

- Because there was nothing else.

And I was like, wow, that's cool.

And that was enough encouragement

or, you know, affirmation.

Like, even though I knew the numbers,

I was like, well, anybody
who opens up iTunes

and goes to, they'll
see it, you know, there.

And I was like, that was like a,

I chose to believe that

to be like this signal from the universe.

Like, okay, this is
something you should be doing

and investing in.

And it just kind of grew from there.

- Your podcast though, Rich,

not only are you like an OG in the game,

but you are one of the first people

to do a podcast like that, I think,

that was bringing these
crazy stories of people

and bringing those stories out

and getting to see another side of them

that up until podcasting
really did hit scale,

nobody knew about.

And you've done that too in your own life.

Not only do you get the guests to come up,

but you're very vulnerable
in your podcast.

I think you probably had some
practice with that though,

it sounds like, with going
through recovery as well.

There was a section in
the book you talk about

where you went to a priest, you know,

and you kind of bore
your soul to this priest.

What have you learned, I guess,

from being so just kind
of bearing your soul,

I guess, to everybody,
both in the podcast world,

but probably in your own life too as well.

What lessons have you gleaned from that?

- Yeah, I mean, I think the courage

to be vulnerable is a very powerful thing

that I try to model.

But I think the word
vulnerability has been sort

of co-opted and commercialized, right?

There's a lot of performative
vulnerability these days.

- Yeah, hashtag vulnerability stuff. Yeah.

- And, you know,
vulnerability doesn't mean

that you have to like
vomit all your craziness

onto everybody at every
opportunity that you have.

There's time and a place
and a context for, you know,

sharing some of those
harder things to share.

But I have found, and I've
learned through recovery.

I mean, listen.

You go to an AA meeting.

What is it?

Somebody gets up in front
of a group of people

and starts just telling the
craziest stuff you've ever heard

about the most insane
things that they have done.

And they're laughing
while they're doing it.

And they're not judged

by the people who are in front of them.

They're warmly received and embraced.

And what you get out of that is

that those experiences no
longer hold power over them.

They're not things to be ashamed of.

They're things that happened
that you've worked through.

And I think when you
have healed those things

in a certain way, when you
share them with other people,

it can come off as sometimes shocking.

Like, oh my God.

Like, he just admitted
that he did that thing?

But I think beneath the
surface, people are like, wow.

Like that thing doesn't
own that person anymore.

And I think that that is
like holding your hand out

to somebody and saying,
"It's gonna be okay."

Like, come over here.

There's a path forward for you

in which those things that keep you stuck

and alone and embarrassed and ashamed

and make you small don't have

to like hold that kind of power over you,

that there is a different way forward.

And I think when you're
vulnerable with people,

it gives people permission
to be vulnerable themselves.

And I think the specificity
of our experiences,

they're gonna be different for everyone.

Like the facts of my background

and experience are gonna
be different from yours.

But if I share openly and vulnerably,

I know that within that,

there'll be something that you can connect

to your own experience.

So it's an invitation in.

And it's a way of saying, in
the context of podcasting,

like I always try to, you know,

model some vulnerability
or open with vulnerability

because I'm trying to emotionally connect

with the guest, right?

And I can't expect them to open up

if I'm not willing to do it.

So you have to like,
you have to like create

that safe environment for
that kind of thing to occur.

And when I wrote "Finding Ultra,"

I mean, first of all, like,

I'm like, I can't even
believe I got a book deal.

It's not like, I didn't
even win any races.

Like this is supposed to
be some sports memoir?

Like I'm not an Olympic athlete.

I didn't, you know, I didn't,

I wasn't, and I wasn't 350 pound.

Like my weight loss thing
wasn't that dramatic.

The athletic accomplishments are fine,

but there's plenty of people out there

who have done far more impressive things.

So what is it about this story

and the way that I tell it?

What is it about it that could
be meaningful for somebody?

And I go, I knew, I
understood from my experience

in recovery that the extent

to which the book would be able to connect

with people was gonna be directly related

to my courage to be open about
things that I'm not proud of.

And that has been the case.

And I think, especially
in an environment now

where everybody is so careful

about what to say and what not to say

and we're all kind of walking on eggshells

and afraid of other people's opinions.

I mean, you wrote a whole book about it.

You know, it's like, and
I would consider myself

who's probably still more too captured

by other people's opinions
than I would like to be.

- Yeah.

- But in sharing our vulnerable moments,

we can find connection
and it brings us closer

to people in a world that
I think is far too divided

and looking for reasons to be separated.

- Last set of questions.

What do you give too many fucks about?

What do you give not enough fucks about?

And what do you give just right. (laughs)

- Interesting.

I definitely still give too many fucks

about other people's opinions.

- [Mark] Interesting.

- Yeah, and this is like,

this is something I'm super
committed to like overcoming.

And could probably be
cured for the most part

if I just restrained my social media use.

- Is it the comment section specifically

or is it like industry peers
or is it press and media?

Like what is it?

- I mean, it's all of it.

- All of the above?
- You know what I mean?

Like why do I care?

You know what I mean?

I've been doing this a long
time. Like I know who I am.

I know, you know,

I know what my strengths
and my weaknesses are.

And what I'm doing is not for everybody.

And the bigger that you get,

then of course you're
gonna have all these people

that don't like it.

And I've gotten a lot better.

I'm just not as liberated
from it as I would like to be.

And I recently had this conversation

with Michael Gerber 'cause
he wrote this book, you know.

He wrote a book on the same subject.

And he calls it FOPO.

Like Fear of Other People's Opinions

and the way that that becomes
this impediment to mastery.

So I would like to be more liberated.

Maybe you can be my guru.

(Mark laughing) I'll get you to a point

where you can run more
than 10 miles and enjoy it.

- There we go. We'll trade off.

- If you could gimme to give less fucks

about what other people think.

What was the other one?

What do I-

- What do you give to me?

What do you give too few fucks about?

- Too few fucks about?

Well, this is something I'm working on

that also I've gotten better at.

And it's not that I give
too few fucks about it,

but I don't prioritize it enough,

which is investing in the
intimacy of my friendships.

You know, I'm 57 now.

And I've been a workaholic.

And a lot of that was fueled by some PTSD

from having my trash cans taken away

and like not wanting to
go back to that place.

But now, everything's cool.

And I can kind of breathe.

But I still like, I'm like, you know,

that thing where it's
all gonna get taken away.

Like I have to maintain
that level of intensity.

And that comes at the
cost of spending time

with people I care about
or investing in friendships

and relationships and
saying yes to experiences

because I have to work or
I have to do this thing

or, you know, you don't
understand how busy I am.

So at what point am I allowed to like,

enjoy my success and relax a little bit

and reconnect with the
people that I care about

as opposed to putting blinders on

and just being in this like
marathon race running forward.

Like to what end, you know?

Like where am I going exactly?

- I can relate to that, yeah.

- I was gonna say it
sounds familiar, Mark.

- Yeah, right?
- [Rich] Yeah.

- And then what have you,

what do you feel like you've nailed?

Like the perfect allotment of fucks given.

- I think I'm pretty good at life, man.

(Mark laughing) You
know, like I think I am.

Like I have an amazing wife.

And I've been in, you know,

that I've been with for 25 years.

We have a healthy relationship.

I mean, we have issues just like any,

you're gonna be in a part
in an intimate partnership

with someone for a long time,

you're gonna have stuff, right?

But we've gone through a lot together.

And not only have we stayed connected,

like we've grown alongside each other

and we've been each other's champions.

We have four amazing kids,

all of whom are like doing
great and we're proud of,

and who are all pursuing their
own dreams with our support.

And they like coming home
and hanging out with us.

- Hey.
- Like they look, they want,

you know, it's like they
want it, not in a weird way,

in like just the right
amount of way, right?

Where like we enjoy their company

and they enjoy being around
us, which is really cool.

- That's a big one.

- So I feel like that's, you know,

of all things, like, that's
something I'm super proud of.

And then I get to like do
this thing that I love,

that I look forward to doing.

And I get excited about every
single day when I wake up.

And then I get to share it
with people who also value it.

And then I am able to
pay my bills doing it.

And I get to choose cool
experiences that I want to go.

Like, I feel like I have
just the right amount

of fucks that I'm giving
about the whole macro pie

and making it all work.

- [Mark] Yeah.
- And that doesn't mean

on a day-to-day basis,

it doesn't get out of
balance and out of whack.

And, yes, I can be a workaholic.

And I, you know, I have plenty of areas

that I need to address
and where I can improve.

But overall, like I just,

I can't even believe that
I have the life I have.

And I'm super grateful and proud.

I'm proud of myself.

But I'm also, again, like
I said at the outset,

like aware that this was
not me, you know, here.

- Amazing.

Thank you, Rich.

- Yeah, thanks. This was super fun.
