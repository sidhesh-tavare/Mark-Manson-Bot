Drew I'm feeling very French this

morning what is that very uh very toot

Leong okay very uh Mercy

bku sule WWA we we well it's just I feel

like French people they have this saying

where they say beauty is pain that if

you want to talk about what makes life

beautiful then there's a certain degree

of discomfort that's required in

observing that beauty I actually have

this argument with my wife often times

about music I will play an absolutely

gorgeous song that's in a minor key and

she'll complain that it's sad and I'm

like it's not sad it's beautiful it's

[ __ ] it's The Melancholy it's the

Instagram meme of don't be sad at ha

wait don't be sad wait how does it go

don't be sad be happy it happened oh I

remember it's the Instagram meme don't

be sad it's gone be happy it happened

okay that's what today's episode is

it's about French people on Instagram

memes no it's actually we're going to

talk about how how ugly and painful

truths are actually what makes life feel

rich and beautiful and I should probably

stop so why don't you kick us off let's

get off of that train real quick

yeah bro do you even podcast like

bro this is the subtle art of not giving

a [ __ ] podcast guest with your host

markk

Manson well the first one uh if you want

a life of meaning at some point you have

to choose a life of suffering why says

who I think you've said this before

actually [ __ ] God damn it all right I

guess I'm stuck here all right no I mean

this is this is one of the big points

that I made in subtle art of not giving

a [ __ ] and I think it resonates today

because I think so much of our culture

is optim for pleasure and kind of

superficial meaningless pleasure empty

calorie pleasure and the truth is is

that pleasure is not the same thing as

happiness uh I have a section in the

book that I talk about how people

mistake highs for happiness highs come

from very temporary

short-term meaningless Pleasant

experiences whereas generally lifelong

happiness emerges out of a a consistent

commitment or sacrifice or willing to

suffer for some greater cause or purpose

so it's this counterintuitive ability to

step into challenges and discomfort it

sucks in the short term but it it

ultimately it's the Instagram meme Drew

it's don't be sad it happened be happy

wait no don't be sad it hurt be happy

that it

happened yes no but there's a difference

here between uh chosen suffering and

suffering you didn't choose

to right so I think a lot of people um

think you know life is suffering or

choose your suffering or whatever chosen

suffering is really what imbus our lives

with a lot more meaning than just say

random suffering or trauma that we that

we face right which I think there's so

there's two things here one is kind of

legitimate victimization situations

where where you are pain is thrust upon

you completely outside of your control

you know so some terrible tragedy

happens or you get a cancer nosis or

something but I would argue that most of

this actually comes down to how we

Define choice for oursel and I think

what often happens is that we choose one

side of an experience while either

denying or remaining oblivious to the

other side I saw there's this hilarious

thing that went viral a couple days ago

right now as we're recording this there

are a bunch of student protests on

campuses students protesting the Israel

war in Gaza regardless of what you feel

about the situ

there were a group of students at

columia who were occupying the quad

occupying the administrator building for

days and days and days on end and then

they were demanding that the school give

them food and they were complaining that

they were hungry and the reporter was

like well wait I thought you wanted to

be

revolutionary you now you're asking them

to feed

you like to me that's a perfect example

of they chose something without

realizing they chose it right it's like

okay if you're going to choose to

protest by occupying a building

potentially illegally and being aware of

those consequences and being willing to

be arrested and being willing to be

criticized and ridiculed for your

beliefs part of that is that your lunch

doesn't get

catered part of that is that like you

need to figure out how to go get food

and water you have bre for sure yeah

like it's it's that was part of your

choice whether you realized it or not

maybe you didn't think about it ahead of

time and that's its own problem but

don't pretend like you didn't choose

this like this is part of what you chose

and I think we we all do that a certain

amount in our lives right like it's we

tend to choose the benefits of something

and we pretend like we didn't choose the

costs and then when the costs show up we

get really upset and blame somebody else

right yeah I I think to just watching

you over the years too I think one thing

you've chosen uh in your life is the

ability to be disliked or I guess just

that you've accepted to a degree that a

lot of people don't I've had a lot ofce

yeah yeah I've gotten a lot of practice

how does that like what how much of that

was a conscious choice or how much of it

was just like this happens and I this is

this is part of the game first of all

let me back up even a little bit further

this is kind of the the higher version

of this question just removing myself

from it is you know I often get

approached by people who want

to write a book or start a podcast or

build an audio audience online and and

one of the most common questions I get

from those people is like what do I do

with criticism what do I do with hate

comments how do I how do I do this and

not get blasted by trolls and haters and

my answer is always like you don't

that's just part of it that's part of

what you're signing up for and generally

like the the the size of your audience

is going to be proportional to the

[ __ ] negativity and hate that you

get and it's just part of the deal some

people are not naturally disposed to

handle that well like I've known a

number of peers in this space and other

authors who just they really struggle

with criticism and hate and the [ __ ]

that happens on social media and then

some people seem pretty disposed

predisposed to just handle it well I

think I'm predisposed to handle it well

whether that's kind of just my natural

personality or you know I grew up in an

environment that I I felt like a fish

out of water since I was a young

you know so it's like I was never the

cool kid in school I was bullied I was

called a nerd a dork a loser you know

all those things so I think I just grew

up with a thicker skin and was like this

is just kind of natural you know for me

so to me that wasn't a super hard choice

but it's also easy for me to recognize

well yeah dude if you want millions of

people to see your [ __ ] some of them are

going to hate it and you're going to

hear from those people people and that's

just the price of injury essentially

yeah I think it was was it Dan Kennedy

who said if you haven't pissed off

someone by lunch you're probably not

doing anything interesting or something

like that yeah he said if yeah if you

haven't if you haven't pissed somebody

off by lunch you're probably not making

much money yeah that's what it was yeah

yeah

yeah which I feel like is truer than

ever today uh truer than ever I don't

know what is a pain that you have chosen

that you think most people have not

chosen I I think I don't know my whole

life is pain Mars my whole life it's

just P that's actually not true um wow

that I thought I was being French

today I do think I've from a young age I

always kind of have thought different I

feel like I've thought differently than

a lot of people around me part of that

just where I grew up and everything like

that I don't know if I've uh chosen like

huge pains or anything like that but

I've always been kind of proud of like

just of being different being like a

little bit different or being um

speaking out um when really not popular

I found myself in those situations

several times I remember you know I grew

up in small town Nebraska um and uh it

was a great time and place to grow up

there actually when I grew up but I

remember in high school uh we had a

debate a quote unquote debate and it was

about the death penalty and I was the

only one who was anti-de penalty in the

whole class and I remember like doing

that and I was like oh it's okay to do

that I remember I remember doing that

and like all my friends are over there

like yelling at me and everything like

that and I took it and I'm like yeah

that's and and that's a small example

but I I've done that throughout my life

where it's like okay when when it's

something that I feel is right and

standing up for it I'll I'll suffer that

I think that's a that's an important

thing to realize about yourself and it's

also I don't know if I always relished

it but I definitely relish it now like

there's kind of a as you pointed out

like a pride of you know what no one's

saying this I'm going to be the one that

says it like that's and I'll take you do

that for sure I'll take the Heat and I

get kind of like a sick masochistic

pleasure out of doing that um before we

move on I I do want to return to this

idea of definition of choice because I

think the magic of this concept is that

if you want to be philosophical you

start to realize that you can expand the

definition of choice to Encompass almost

anything right so a few minutes ago I

used the example of like a tragedy you

know you get in a car accident or you

get a cancer diagnosis on the one hand

you could look at that and say this is

so unfair it's random why did this

happen I would never choose this Etc on

the other hand you can expand your

definition of choice to a point where

everything starts to feel like a choice

in your life that you had some hand in

so you know let's say you get in a car

accident well obviously you didn't

choose to be in the car accident but you

chose the drive and statistically a

certain percentage you know everybody

ends up in a car accident at some point

certain percentage of people end up in

serious car accidents at some point and

so if you were living in a busy City and

choosing the drive in choosing to be

engaged on the road at busy and

dangerous times like that in effect is a

choice to a certain extent and that may

sound really uh obnoxious like just you

know splitting hairs but I do think

there's value in that because it forces

you to recognize the tradeoffs that you

made right so there's huge benefits of

living in a big city and driving often

and as you're enjoying those benefits

year after year after year you're not

really thinking about the costs and then

when the cost comes you want to pretend

like you never you never made the choice

like that cost was thrust upon you

completely outside of your control and

in a sense it wasn't like you chose to

be there you chose to be in the car you

chose to be driving every day and

statistically knowing that one day

you're likely to end up in an accident

so that's a very philosophical way uh

you know it may s that may sound like

Naval gazing but I personally found that

very very powerful in my life when like

very unfortunate things that have

happened that seemingly were outside of

my

control I just zoom out as far as I can

until the definition of my choice

incompasses whatever happened and then

it

removes the power that it has over me

yeah it's like

okay I I chose to be here I chose to

live this way I chose this lifestyle I

chose to pursue this career to be

friends with these people that has

repercussions right today's episode is

listening. GF change is often born from

trauma yes I brought this up briefly

when I talked to Abigail shrier maybe a

month ago but this concept of

post-traumatic growth I feel like it's

it's so under publicized underrated yeah

maybe maybe this is the the drum we bang

on this year Drew is is just like let's

bang on the post-traumatic growth drum

because I'm in for that yeah trauma is

just like it's such a [ __ ] trendy

topic these days and everybody's talking

about their trauma and how traumatized

they are and it's like if you actually

look at the research of what happens to

people post trauma a far greater

percentage of them will look back after

the fact and attribute growth to the

traumatic event than people who end up

suffering from PTSD and the reason this

is so important is because of the

expectation effect is that people if you

tell people that trauma is debilitating

and you tell people that that their

trauma is going to [ __ ] up their lives

and it's going to hold them back forever

it makes it more likely that the trauma

will and if you tell people that trauma

leads to growth and that trauma can be

one of the best things that happens to

you and that trauma can be leveraged for

all these beneficial things over the

long run it's more likely to to lead to

growth you wrote an article years ago

how to grow from your pain that we talk

about post-traumatic growth in as well

so if people want to check that out I

think that's a good place to start with

this it's a fascinating area of

psychology though and like a really

robust um theory that they've tested in

all sorts of different um areas and

everything like that and again under

broadcast I don't know why yeah I don't

you would think the self-help industry

would be all over this [ __ ] but it seems

to be the opposite it seems to be just

telling people how traumatized they are

all the time like almost trying to

convince people they have PTSD instead

of ptg right and in case anybody's

listening to this and is like well

that's easy for you to say you know

whatever this line of research actually

started in the 1950s with a guy named

kmir debrowski who took Holocaust

Survivors and he tracked them the

decades after the Holocaust and he was

the first one who noticed that 10 years

15 years 20 years out a majority of the

Holocaust Survivors said that they were

a better person for surviving the

Holocaust and while they would never go

back and do it again and they would

never choose to have it happen that

ultimately they ended up becoming a

better person for having that experience

and so he was the he called it positive

disintegration which is not a catchy

term but but essentially it was the the

very early findings of post-traumatic

growth and post-traumatic growth though

too the the whole body of research I

think does a really good job of

explaining like there's yes you can

there's a an opportunity for growth

within this trauma

but that doesn't mean you're not still

traumatized by it the two things can

happen at the same time yes right um

they're not necessarily mutually

exclusive we gave the example of uh in

that article of uh Maya Angelou yeah um

I love her story it's it's I mean she

suffered a great deal of abuse as a

child growing up and then she went on to

become you know a an award-winning act

actress and writer U wrote the first

best novel by a black female I know why

the Cage Bird Sings f fantastic story

that she has in an interview one time

she said though the writing process for

her was dragging her pencil over her

scars to sharpen it God I just love that

line it's so good because it illustrates

just how you know she's like this trauma

is still there all of that's still there

and I use it in my in my life in a way

that's that that brings me to a

different level even though it's still

there it's almost like trauma I'm going

to sound a little woo woo here warning

fair warning Mark's going to a little

woooo here but I I mean this

metaphorically but like it's almost like

trauma creates these like energy centers

right like the almost like a power plant

like it's just it just radiates energy

within your your mind and your

subconscious and you can channel that

energy in any direction you want you can

Channel it

into compulsive behaviors

self-destructive behaviors like it needs

to go somewhere right so if you were

kind of autopilot or uh in a bad

environment it can very easily lead you

down a destructive path because you just

need to get that energy out in some some

shape or form but if you manage to

channel it in a positive direction like

she did it can actually Propel you you

know it can actually motivate you and

make you more effective more productive

more energized I remember I had a I went

to high school with a bunch of guys who

fought in Iraq and Afghanistan I

remember hanging out with a guy um after

he got back doing a couple tours in Iraq

and he was one of these guys like he was

like going door too in mosul and FIA

like knocking on doors looking for

terrorists and stuff so it's like every

like you just knock on the next door and

it's like you could just get shot as

soon as the door opens and he came back

got an amazing job started a company had

this incredible like just basically just

went from zero to 100 on the career

ladder in like a year and I remember

talking to him about it and I was like

God damn dude like you're killing it

like congrats amazing and I remember he

just looked at me and he's like dude

after I rack like everything's easy yeah

he's like there's nothing hard about

this right I don't know it was just one

of those moments that like I felt like a

total

[ __ ] I was like man I like what am I

doing no it does put it in perspective

back to the channeling thing though um

it it's the research what the research

finds is that it's it's the channeling

itself yeah it's not the trauma you know

that that makes you thrive or get better

whatever it's the Chan it's what how you

react to it in the aftermath and so

you're right going back to the abriel

shrier thing um if you're telling people

that this is just going to [ __ ] you up

you're you're channeling that in the

wrong direction yeah and it it's the

process after the trauma that that that

makes us that levels us up yeah that's

an important point to make this is one

of my favorite quotes this comes from

David Foster W he said evil people don't

believe they are evil they believe

everyone else is evil tell me about this

we've kind of touched on this a couple

of times the older I get the less I

trust people who bang on about how other

people are doing horrible things and

they don't even try to understand where

they're coming from or don't even try to

think of what would I do in that

situation yeah it just goes back to

there's like that Alexander Soulja niten

quote where he says the line between

good and evil runs down every human

heart yeah right it's all within us and

I think if you convince yourself that

you're not evil and everybody else is

you can convince yourself of doing a lot

of evil actually in a weird way I feel

like I I mean I wonder if there's ever

been any research on this but like I

imagine if you could measure

self-righteousness in people and then

measure [ __ ] up antisocial Behavior

those two things would probably

correlate there's so another great quote

around this is that um Mary sh said that

every atrocity is committed in the name

of the greater good she has another

quote which is that no man commits evil

because he thinks it's evil he mistakes

it for happiness I I just think that the

more certain and closed off we become of

what's right and wrong what's good

what's bad what's going to make us happy

what's going to make us

miserable the less ambiguity we allow

the more Justified we're going to feel

when attacking others and treating other

people unfairly when this topic comes up

the thing it always reminds me of there

was like this period in the early 2000s

you probably remember this where there

was like over like 5 years there was a

series of mega church pastors like

basically like the most homophobic

Evangelical Church ministers and pastors

they all turned out to be like hiring

male prostitutes and like doing cocaine

with like really gay orgies and stuff

and and it's like these are these are

guys who are on TV every week

shouting about how like homosexuality is

an Abomination how everybody's going to

go to hell how the country's going to be

ruined and then it's you know it's like

turns out he was in a hotel with a a

hooker off Craigslist you know giving

him a [ __ ] and uh you know Carl Young

had this thing about the Shadow Self and

projection and I think there's a

tendency that certainty that we develop

over what's good and bad often times we

develop that certainty because we need

it to bury what we don't like about

ourselves right so it's like if there's

a part of yourself that you are

terrified to confront one way you can

hide it from yourself is just developing

this like very strict black and white

view of the world and never ever budging

from that does that make sense it does

yeah and then because then when that

shadow comes up you don't know what to

do with it because you've ignored it for

so long right um and and that's where

just the heinous awful [ __ ] can happen

you see it in politics and everything

like that but I think you can see it in

your everyday life as well just people I

don't know when I'm like walking down

the street and somebody doesn't move

over I'm like what a piece of

[ __ ] you know and I I know that's that's

a that's a mundane example or whatever

Shadow Self show merges just driving out

here in

LA but that's what I'm talking about if

you notice those little things in in

your everyday life you're like oh I

could take this to some dark [ __ ]

places if I if if I let it happen it's

also I think just an argument to just

kind of remain more Vigilant um and and

stand up and and call call out [ __ ]

when you do see it but also I think have

a little bit of give people a little bit

of leeway too when they [ __ ] up yeah I I

I generally find that people with this

sort of certainty and I I would call it

like an almost like a ideological or

religious view of the world and of

people they tend to be full of

contradictions you know there's this

thing called the manosphere and it's the

the red pill community and it's funny

because it's been around forever like it

was around when I started in men's

stating advice in the late 2000s it was

around it's still around a lot of the

same guys are still there still posting

the same [ __ ] which that tells you

something I always feel like you can

judge the quality of a of a

self-improvement community by how many

people leave it if nobody's leaving then

it's a [ __ ] trap yeah stay away that

is a black for so you know the

manosphere is definitely a trap it's a

black hole but it's always I've always

found it amusing how these guys you'll

see these guys angrily bang on I mean

it's it's just like super sexist and

judgmental towards women and they'll

write these like long essays digging

into evolutionary psychology and giving

you every reason why women are terrible

and feminism is ruining ruining the

world and things are so unfair for men

now and how like you know women saw and

it's this is [ __ ] and I just sit

there and I'm like okay if women are

this terrible like why are you literally

spending every hour of your free time

thinking about them and writing about

them like I don't know the things that I

think suck I just kind of go do

something else you know like I don't pay

attention to them I like I go find

something more productive to do there's

like this weird fixation that a lot of

people develop on what they deem evil

like there's kind of this Fascination or

Obsession that they develop around it

and um and yeah it just feels very

counterproductive counter to everything

that they purport to be saying well yeah

and go back to your point though it's

like but you you reject what could

possibly reject you it's like a

protective mechanism as well as going

back to that shadow thing yeah that's

the whole manosphere is like that I

think for sure so man manosphere and uh

closet of gay preachers

next one um the next one death is a gift

that Gives Life Meaning ah wee wee this

is so French I love it I love it where's

my bag

at this is this is very French very sart

very uh K yeah it is it's quite

existential you know my one of my

favorite press or media moments what

ever was so my books are not big in

France they're they did okay but uh not

not a huge French audience and I

remember like one of the only kind of

big media opportunities I ever had in

France it was a French journalist like

one of the big newspapers there and I

get on the phone with her and she starts

asking me a couple questions like kind

of about the book and we get like May 5

minutes into the conversation and she's

like she's like look I'm really sorry

but aren't these things just kind of

obvious yes and I was like yes you know

you would think so and she was like

maybe maybe it's just here in France but

I just feel like everybody knows these

things I I do love the French for that

too they're very honest they're very

honest I was like yeah this I'm I'm

definitely not going to get a lot of

real estate space in that

newspaper it's like American guy repeats

what's obvious yeah yeah what do the

French know about death Mark so this is

my interpretation of it this is not what

the ex existentialist said entirely

although I I guess this is kind of an

extension of it but like death is the

only really permanent thing everything

else of value is kind of relative or you

can they're tradeoffs or interchangeable

in some shape or form death is the only

finality and so death is what generates

scarcity of everything else ultimately

we all have a scarcity of time we don't

know how much time but the fact that

there is a scarcity of time is what

makes our time valuable and the fact

that our time is valuable forces us to

make value based decisions about

everything else that we do and pursue in

life and those value-based decisions are

what makes life meaningful the fact that

I choose to spend my time on a podcast

instead of I don't know like gardening

and my backyard that feels like a

meaningful choice to me uh the fact that

I chose to spend my my life with my wife

as opposed to some other woman I dat it

that feels meaningful because that time

is scarce I never get it back once it's

used it's gone forever and one day it'll

be used up so ultimately death is the

the object that uh I was going to try to

do like a very poetic metaphor and I

just you know this is why I write Drew I

I just you know you give me if you give

me five minutes I'll I'll give you a

perfect metaphor but you know when I

just have to sit here and talk you're

going to end up with a lot of [ __ ]

so I think in subtle art I say something

like death cast The Shadow by which

everything else is measured yeah there

there it is there you go it is nailed it

edit that we're gonna we're just G to

make me sound poetic as [ __ ]

uh death cast The Shadow by which

everything else is measured and I think

that is the reason why I think most

people have the experience that either

when somebody close to them passes away

or when they have a health scare

themselves or a mortality scare

themselves like a near-death experience

it clarifies their values it clarifies

all those decisions that they've been

making and maybe the decisions that they

haven't been making well so we started

the show talking about the importance of

choice and how often we make choices

without being aware of the repercussions

of those choices or the the full extent

of what we're choosing death is the

thing that makes you aware of the extent

of what you're choosing death is what

makes you aware of like oh I've been

wasting my time with people that don't

really care about me oh I'm investing in

a career that yeah makes me a bunch of

money and gets me a bunch of status and

Prestige but it doesn't feel impactful

and it's not making me happy like death

clarifies those things in a way that

nothing else seems to and I think this

is why the Buddhists and the stoic

had this practice of contemplating your

own death um and find seeing the value

and importance of that just because it

it helps you align your internal Compass

towards whatever you should be pointing

at there's also in this space I think

there's people they make a similar point

but I think it's a little more

superficial just like yeah you're going

to die someday your time is limited so

get busy that kind of thing which you

know that's there's value in that for

sure there's a number of different ways

you can respond to this though too right

you could you could just turn to just

nihilism too right like we're all going

to die so what's the point anyway

there's a whole another body of research

too Terror management theory that talks

about like when you're aware of your

death and they do all these experiments

where they you know they call it

mortality salience where they remind

people you're going to die and then they

give them all sorts of different tests

and they find all sorts of interesting

things and you know we want to leave a

legacy um because we're aware of our

deaths and it's a way for us not to die

and all that kind of stuff but there's

also there's another side of it too

where um yes that can make you more

charitable it can make you um think

about your purpose more all that it

could also make you more materialistic

it can also make you more pleasure

seeking and short-term seeking like well

I'm going to die I may as well get it

all in really quick too so I think

that's a point that doesn't get made a

lot too um you have to really be careful

with this one because I think there is a

way like you know there's like a you

know YOLO [ __ ] it just whatever Hedonism

all to the max you know what this

reminds me of I don't know if this is a

true story I remember reading about it

years ago is that there was a guy who

was suicidal he had basically planned to

end his own life but at the last minute

he was like well you know what I should

go blow all my savings first I remember

this so he went down he went down to

Mexico and spent all of his money on

cocaine and hookers and just like had

this insane like two we bender and then

at the end of it he was like wait I want

to live this is

awesome okay maybe I'm wrong okay

I don't know what conclusion we take

from any of this but I think that's a a

signal to move on so bring it back down

to earth a little bit here what are

there any experiences you've had with

death that have really brought that home

for you I mean obviously you've talked

about the one about your friend Josh

yeah early on in life that's a a big

impactful one um were there any others

that you can think of that brought that

home for you I think a lot of this

happened early in my life without me

realizing in it like I had a number

of family members and people in my life

who died around me I didn't realize till

I was an adult and I actually met other

people who said that they had never had

anybody close to him died to realize how

kind of strange my so like three of my

four grandparents died when I was

growing up I had two classmates died my

friend Josh died like all that happened

before the age of 20 and then even in my

early 20s I knew a couple other people

who passed away in like tragic

circumstances so I think I was exposed

to this more than most people growing up

and maybe without even being conscious

of It kind of took some of these lessons

from that I'm seeing this a lot now with

my parents and that generation of my

family my aunts and uncles and everybody

they're all hitting that age where sorry

Mom and Dad if you when you listen to

this but it's true it's like they're all

hitting that age where

it's like okay there's probably less

than 10 good Christmases left yeah you

know there's probably less than a half a

dozen family reun reunions left with

these people or all these people like

it's we're getting down where you can

count probably count the times on two

hands of like how many really good years

you're going to have with them before

the health really kind of deteriorates

and falls apart so that's made me a lot

more conscious of take the time spend

the time you know the little things

maybe when my stepmom or my mom say

something that you know 10 years ago

would like set me off now I'm just like

you know what let it go yeah yeah um and

just basically be grateful and and try

to really take advantage of of the time

that I have with them yeah yeah I don't

I mean I don't know what the difference

was because I feel like I was exposed to

a lot of death too pretty young age it

seemed like I went to a lot of funerals

before I was 20 as well yeah um friends

and family alike um it didn't really hit

home from me until a few years ago when

uh my my uncle passed away and I was

actually the one who called the

ambulance for him um he was um fighting

cancer um and and uh thought he had a

couple of years left but um yeah one day

I was helping him in the yard and uh we

had to call the ambulance for him and

the next day he passed away and he was

my uncle he didn't have any kids so he

was very much uh he was very much an

uncle to us you know very much a friend

of ours and you know I was just talking

to my parents about you know they were

talking about the village it took to

raise their kids and everything and he

was part of that Village for sure and I

don't know what it was about him maybe

it was just like the right age you know

I was in my mid upper 30s at the time

and um just yeah it was one of those

things he had just retired too so he had

yeah thought he had 20 years ahead of

him and he ended up only having like a

year or two and dude that's the other

thing yeah my dad had a guy who worked

for him um great great guy who great

worked for my dad for like 20 30 years

great you know worked his ass off and he

had this dream he was basically saving

everything for decades M uh cuz his plan

was

to buy a buy a sailboat and just sail I

forget what it was it was like sail from

like North America to the tip of South

America and back or something but like

this huge kind of Epic sailing trip that

him and his wife had dreamed about for

like 10 20 years and every extra dollar

went to saving for that trip for paying

for the boat and buying all the supplies

and everything and he did this for years

and years and years everybody at the

office knew he was doing it he retired

in like two months later he got a cancer

diagnosis God and it

like that might have been another cuz I

think that happened when I was probably

around 18 or 20 and

um I I remember just looking that and

thinking like dude don't wait MH for

stuff like that like don't

[ __ ] put it on the back burner and

tell yourself one day like it's if you

want to do something epic just [ __ ]

go do it no for sure I've been thinking

about that a lot recently too just like

how fortunate I was to travel when I was

young and yeah and just kind of do it

and I was broke and stupid and whatever

but no regrets about that in some ways

it's better when you're broken stupid

fantastic actually yeah yeah for sure

IDGAF you do not actually

exist you do not exist Drew you are a

figment this podcast imagination all of

the listeners right now you are you are

listening to a concept in a collection

of stimuli known as Drew birdie that's

right and Mark Manson Mar this applies

to you as well you're not I'm pretty

sure I

exist what do you mean we have you and

quotation marks what do you mean you in

quotation marks

um so this is this is very Buddhist

which is this idea that your conception

of who you are is really just

this network

of beliefs and associations that you've

picked up throughout your life you know

I am a writer my name is Mark I am from

Texas I am a podcaster these are all

simply associations that I've decided or

true MH

and I can choose to identify Myself by

those things are not not and in Buddhism

they encourage you to not Define

Yourself by anything like what's there

when you strip away all of these

associations you know you have a name

one of the things that Buddhists say a

lot is or or my old zen Mas used to say

a lot is he he would say um you know you

have a name but you are not your name

you have anger or you have happiness but

you are not angry you are not happy

you have an experience as a student but

you are not a student um so if you are

not any of those things what are you

what's left when you strip everything

away and the truth is nothing there's

nothing there the same way you invent a

concept in your head of you know the

same way a a sports team is just a

madeup concept of Like Somebody went to

a field and painted some lines on a

field and decided those 11 guys are

going to stand there and those 11 guys

are going to stand there and that's this

team and that's that team completely

madeup Concepts that we all get together

and agree or real quote unquote

real your definition of yourself is the

same way you painted lines inside your

head you told yourself to go stand in

certain boxes and then you told yourself

that that that was real and we tend to

go through our entire lives not

realizing we did that and it's important

because so much of our suffering is

derived from those lines and those boxes

that we painted in our heads and decided

to stand in without realizing like dude

you can just step out of that box

anytime you want like you don't have to

be that you can just decide like okay I

guess I'm not that thing I'm not

anything and for me I I think this is

what most people you know when people

are introduced to Buddhism and

meditation this tends to be kind of like

the first really

profound Insight that they experience

and it was definitely true with me I

think it's important to kind of tie it

back to I guess more

western style therapy it's useful

because you know essentially what

therapy is is taking these old

narratives of what you decided you are

or aren't based on prior experiences and

helping you evaluate those and question

those and and decide whether they're

true or not or whether you want to keep

them or not it's it's essentially like

helping you locate where the lines and

boxes are that you drew and then helping

you step out of them if you so choose I

have a almost a perfect example of that

I guess that has happened recently for

me you know I've talked about this

before I I I have I tend to have a

pretty avoidant attachment and kind of

keep people at arms length a lot that's

a story I've told myself for a very long

time it's crazy cuz you know when I was

doing research and everything like that

I studied this kind of stuff so I knew

you know attachment uh Styles and

attachment science and all the research

around it and everything like that and I

I intellectualized it a lot and I came

to identify as I'm avoidant I am

avoidant like you're talking right

that's that identity I am uh avoidant

and I keep people at arms length and

everything like that what I've come to

find like when I started questioning

that not only am I not as avoidant as I

think I am but I can just choose not to

be and like I've gotten to the point

where I was like oh I

catch myself and choose not to be and

like lean into that instead and it took

me far too long far far too long but

I've come to that um point now and it's

kind of a mind [ __ ] a little bit and

it's scary you know what I mean like

letting that go because that was such a

protective thing for me I think for so

long yeah it's one of those things that

when you do make that shift you're

almost like angry at yourself cuz you're

like totally wait this was available to

me the entire [ __ ] time and I never

took it right seriously but you get so

caught up in all these stories and

explanations and and and theories and

that yeah you you lose sight of the fact

of like yeah you painted a line here you

chose to stand behind it and you can

just step over anything you want I think

there there's so many instances of that

especially kind of in the modern Western

therapy or the way we talk about mental

health too like I am avoiding or I'm

anxious or you know what whatever your

love language is I I need all this and

it's like well okay can you step back

for a second and how much of that are

you choosing really there's a little bit

of a self-fulfilling prophecy there

right and it it's and this comes back to

kind of the trauma thing of like the

danger of putting a narrative on the

experience before you've like fully had

the experience like if you tell yourself

that being an avoidant is going to

prevent you from having Intimate

Relationships then any time you

confronted with an intimate relationship

you're just like you you're probably

less likely to be able to commit right

whereas if you remove that narrative

then and you just decide I'm just going

to experience this relationship for what

it is and try not to have any judgments

or preconceived notions or any

narratives around it then you're

probably going to have a much higher

probability of success and I don't know

sometimes I I just kind of had this

thought on the fly like I think

sometimes what is useful in in

Psychology and personal velopment what

is useful for description is not useful

for prescription what I mean by that is

like creating these Concepts and

narratives can be useful to explain to

people what's happening but that

explanation can unintentionally prevent

them from taking the actions that will

make it better and often the the

explanations and narratives that help

people take action and make it better

are very poor at explaining what what

people are going through and those two

things probably get get mixed up right

quite a bit no but I think you're right

it's the language around it that you use

if you say I like in my case I am

avoidant that's different than the

reason I kind of came to this

realization was I started saying I feel

more comfortable when I'm the avoidant

one in a relationship yeah that

completely changed my framework just

that little that little change right

there and it's like oh I'm acting in a

certain way in these relationships yeah

uh not necessarily that I am predestined

to act that way because when you change

that language you open up the potential

for like if if you're just avoidant and

that's end of story right then it's like

well there's nothing I'm ever going to

do I'm just always going to feel like

anxious and you know push people away

from me whereas when you change that

that language now it's like well I'm

naturally predisposed to feel one way

but I'm also capable of acting and

experiencing other ways absolutely and

what I found was is that I actually have

a way higher need for connection than I

thought before yeah May is why you're

avoidant I was I was denying that yeah

no seriously yeah I think that is I

think that's what it is I was avoidant

my entire life and I remember uh

linguistic Jiu-Jitsu I did with myself

to uh get me to commit to my wife was

basically like I I kept telling myself

you can always break up with her but it

can't be for a stupid reason because I

like every previous relationship I had

just [ __ ] torpedoed for the dumbest

reason imaginable and I was like if this

one ends it can't be for a dumb reason

and so there was like all these moments

throughout like the first couple years

of our relationship where I'd like start

getting like really anxious or like

worked up about something i' be like I

don't know if I can be with her anymore

and then I'm like wait a second that's a

dumb reason like just like go go sleep

on it uh try again tomorrow and uh when

I like created a rule for myself of like

you know no ending relationships for

dumb reasons what do you know I ended up

happily married for 12 years yeah it's

those it's those reframes like that in

those situations around your identities

just reframe them in a small way and it

can usually really eventually at least

lead to a bigger bigger shift yeah cool

well I'm not feeling any less French

than I was an hour ago um but who knows

what we'll feel next time I think that's

it for our episode so be sure to like

And subscribe leave a review leave a

comment comment on my poor poor French

abilities but seriously thank you for
