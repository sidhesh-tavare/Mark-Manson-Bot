- Imagine there's a guy
in the Special Forces

who nearly rips his leg off
in a parachuting accident.

It puts him in the
hospital for nearly a year

and ends his military career.

Now, imagine if that same guy

went on to break cycling world records

with no prior experience cycling.

Yeah, what the fuck?

My guest today is that guy.

His name is Dean Stott,

and he's the baddest
motherfucker I've ever met.

And aside from breaking
absurd cycling world records,

he was a member of the United Kingdom's

Special Forces for 16 years.

He has been on missions in
Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan,

and Yemen, among other
undisclosed locations.

Since leaving the military,
he's worked in private security,

extracting foreigners in war zones,

and protecting members
of the royal family.

As you will see, Dean's mental strength

is absolutely awe inspiring.

He's been in some of

the most difficult situations imaginable,

both mentally and physically.

And in this episode, we're
gonna discuss all of that.

We're gonna talk about
his relationship to pain

and how he's trained
himself over the years

to never be stopped or affected by it.

We're gonna talk about
the psychological benefits

of an absurd amount of planning

and why it's useful to see
everything as a mission

and how Dean thinks about risk.

We'll discuss the importance
of remaining aware

of one's mortality without
also being consumed by it.

We talk about why
understanding local cultures

and respecting each individual
is actually the key to safety

and getting things done

in the most dangerous places in the world.

We talk about his wife

and the role that she
has played in his success

and how they've stayed
connected and happy,

despite the fact that
he keeps doing things

that risk his life.

And in the conversation
Dean shares with us

the one thing that he
believes the military teaches

that every civilian would benefit from.

Dean, if you haven't
noticed, is kind of a badass,

but you'd never know it
by just talking to him.

I met him at a friend's
house a few years ago

where we mostly talked about surfing.

It was only at the end of the night

that someone happened to mention

that he was single-handedly responsible

for evacuating the entire Canadian embassy

from Benghazi and Libya when
the civil war broke out.

And then I was like, "Wait,
what the fuck did he do?"

Dean's laid back, easygoing
nature is as we'll see,

the key to the scope of his success.

Security is after all,
ultimately about managing people,

whether through force or through

mutual respect and understanding.

Dean is world class at both.

Now, this conversation was a blast.

I know it's gonna blow your
mind and be a ton of fun.

But before we get into it,

I have a quick announcement to make.

We are moving the podcast over
to its own YouTube channel.

So, if you're still watching
on the Mark Manson channel,

please go over to The Subtle Art

of Not Giving a Fuck podcast channel

and watch the episodes there.

In July, we're gonna only
post episodes over there,

so pretty soon you're not
gonna see them here anymore.

So, please go over there.

Subscribe, the links in
the description below.

Without further ado, this is Dean Stott.

Let's get into it.

- [Announcer] The podcast
that's saving the world

one fewer fuck at a time.

It's the Subtle Art of
Not Giving A Fuck podcast

with your host, Mark Manson.

- Dean, it's good to see you, man.

- Hey, good to see you again.

- Yeah.
- It been well.

- Yeah. Welcome to the pod, my friend.

You might have the distinction

of being the hardest
motherfucker I personally know.

If there was like a death match
and my life depended on it,

and I to like nominate a champion.

I would call up Dean Stott

- Clearly you don't have
many names in your phone,

but then, no.

- Well, I, you know, I
don't, my circle of friends

are a little bit bookish and nerdy so,

but it's great to see you.

It's great to have you here.

I've known you for a few years.

We've talked a lot about your stories.

I was reviewing your book
the last couple days.

I wanna start with just a very

kind of philosophical question.

How would you describe
your relationship to pain?

- So pain is, it's a respect thing.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

And so for me, I understand
when I'm in pain,

either physically, I
try and take a negative

and turn it into a positive.

So for me, you know,
there's been incidents

throughout my military
career where I've had pain,

whether that's through an injury,

but I also know that you
can work through that pain.

For me, all I need to know is,

if I carry on with this pain threshold,

is there gonna be any long term damage

or is it just short term?

If I realize it's just short term,

then it sort of subsides in my head.

- Yeah.
- And I can manage

to sort of push through it.

And the same in the physical aspect

when I'm doing some of
these big challenges.

You know, I like, I'm
not a glutton for pain.

I just, I don't like pain,

but I can just respect it.

I tend to know now how
far I can push my body

and then realize actually what is actual

just pain through physical endurance

or what is actual pain
through a long-term injury,

A big factor for me was when I got injured

out to Special Forces,
you know, that incident,

I had a parachuting accident,
I exited the aircraft,

my leg got caught up in a line.

And that pain, I'd never
felt pain like that before.

You know, it was that bad.

I was vomiting, because of the pain.

And so, then I knew
that was a distinction.

This is pain I'd never felt before.

It's not like pain
through physical activity.

So, for me, I just know
the varying levels of pains

and I know how far I can push.

I mean, if there's this point

where I realize actually this is too much

and it may have, you know,
detrimental effects long term,

then I'll wind it back.

But if I know that it's
not gonna have an issue,

I'll try and push even harder.

- Did that parachuting incident,

is there like, any sort
of before and after

experience with that of like,

the things that you pushed
through after that incident?

You're like, oh, I've been through

so much worse than this.

Like this is nothing.

- No, with that one
slightly different though.

I've known guys that were
on operations in Afghan

and the guy would, you know,
would go over on his anger.

He actually broke his leg,
carried on the assault,

and then marched out 10 miles afterwards.

You know, because guys don't
wanna let each other down.

And so, I've seen guys
with pain thresholds,

but with this one, I
knew it was different.

Now, I have had fractures before.

I've had numerous injuries.

You know, it's the nature of the beast

in the Special Forces.

But this one was slightly different.

- Yeah.
- This I was like,

I think for me, we were about

to go out to Afghanistan in two weeks time

and that's all I was looking forward to.

And then I sort of knew

I'm not gonna be going with my friends.

And so, it was a mixture of
physically not being able to do,

but mentally trying to
get my head around that.

I think that was probably the
mental was the hard thing.

You know, the physical
act I don't mind with.

- So, I like that the purpose thing

makes a lot of sense, right?

Like if there's some
sort of higher purpose

or deeper cause, right?

Like, that gives a justification of like,

okay, just ignore the pain.

Like I imagine that's a huge part of it,

but it's just funny reading
your story as a civilian

as like somebody who's never
done anything like this, right?

Like I read your story both

in terms of the Special
Forces stuff, you know?

You write about in Kosovo being
up in sub-zero temperatures

up in the mountains for
20 days straight, right?

Or doing the bike, the
Pan-American highway bike ride,

which I just imagine like,

you've probably got blisters on your ass.

You're getting pelted with
like rain and wind and hail.

You're climbing up mountains for

literally weeks and weeks
and weeks in a row, right?

Like, when I try to imagine
myself in those situations,

my experience with like
enduring long durations of pain

is that I eventually reach a point

where my mind is just like
desperate to escape, you know?

And starts rationalizing any
reason I can come up with

of like, get the fuck outta here.

Like, any excuse, any story

that seems even mildly believable.

And so, when I meet somebody
like you, I'm just curious,

like A, do those stories come up

and B, if so, how do you respond to them

or do you respond to them?

- So for me, when it
came to the bike ride,

you know, I'd been in all
those environments before,

but I'd never done it on a bike.

And so, I just literally,

I think if I did that bike
ride at a very young age,

I probably wouldn't
have been able to do it.

I literally was able to do it,

because I'd taken all
those experiences before

and just put it into a sport.

And yeah, like you said, your
worst enemy is your mind.

You know what I mean?

When it is hard and you know, it is tough,

you do start drifting away.

You always look at maybe
the easy route out.

So, actually, for the listeners though,

I'd never cycle more than 20 miles

before I applied for the world record,

for the world's longest
road at 14,000 miles.

And six months before I even
went off on the challenge,

we had a fundraising group together.

We were already planning
the welcome back party

before it even set off, you know?

So, and I remember Amanda, she
was the fundraising manager,

and she said, "Look, Dean," she goes,

"what is the contingency?"

You know, 'cause she had to obviously

think about all these options.

And Alana would say, "Well,
we go to Dean's funeral."

And I never used to answer.

And the reason I didn't answer her,

and I did answer when I got back, I said,

"Look, if I knew there was a contingency,

if I knew it got hard and it got difficult

and there an alternative, you
naturally take that route."

- Yes.
- And so for me,

I was blocking off those exit routes

and it's literally the
only way this is gonna end

is either me dead or we
finish this challenge.

And so, that's I how I
look at it, you know,

in the military,
especially Special Forces,

we are mission driven. You
know, we had a mission.

My mission was to get to Alaska
in quicker than 117 days.

So, that was always the
mission. You know, how we do it,

you know, the plan from
the start to actual,

the way it actually panned out

was two totally different things.

You know, having to
change plans on the road.

And then the other sort of
distractions as well, you know,

is when it getting hard.

You know, we raised money
for a mental health campaign,

which had 11 charities under it.

Everything from young children, teenagers,

postnatal depression, veterans, adults.

And so for me, you know,
one of the charities

I was doing the bike ride
for was called Place To Be,

which was basically,
helping children in school

speak to a counselor and
£100,000 that they got,

well, it enable 14,000 children
to speak to a counselor.

So, I just related that to
the miles that I was doing.

So, each mile I'm on
this bike another child

is getting to speak to someone.

But unlike other, maybe
cycling adventurers out there,

a lot of them they do the bike ride

and they have a team
that sort of coordinate

all the planning and the coordination.

Alana and I did the planning
and coordination for this.

So, that would also was
another distraction for me.

So, rather than just look being

fixated on the bike computer,
I was already thinking about

the next two or three stages as well.

It was almost like a military operation.

So, I had those distractions
when it was hard,

but I also made sure I hit
my targets for the day.

You know, I see people going
out on challenges and like,

well, I'm 10 miles behind today

and I'll catch that up tomorrow.

But you dunno what's
gonna happen the next day.

You know, you could have another bad day

be 20 to 30 miles behind.

So, I always made sure
by the end of the day,

I was where I should be,

because then you're in a good head space

then at the evening when
you go to bed, you know

that the next day we're on
point and where we are so.

- That's interesting, the idea of

providing yourself productive distraction.

The useful things for your mind to work on

that take it kind of away

from the discomfort of the present moment.

But you said the no contingency,

I'm either gonna do this or I'm dead.

I love that. I mean, it reminds me of like

the Spanish conquistadors
burning the boats.

You know, when they came to the new world.

But that also requires a certain comfort

with the possibility of one's own death.

Like I mean, and
obviously doing, you know,

being in Special Forces for so long,

going on all these missions,

well aware of the fact that
you might not come back.

Like how would you say
your relationship is

with thinking about your own mortality?

Do you think about your own mortality

when you're on these missions,

when you're doing extractions,
when you're in war zones?

And if so, like how did you develop

a comfort level with that?

- Yeah, I think you do think
about your immortality.

You are naive to think that

you are indestructible or immortal.

So, for me, you know,
I was very fortunate.

I've been on these operations with guys

and in the Special Forces,

especially like we are in
tier one Special Forces.

And literally, everything
is about mission success,

mission success, and
getting the guys back.

We don't think anything but that.

And we do, we do get guys injured

and we do lose guys along the way.

So for me, you know, I sort
of think I'm very fortunate.

I've been in those
situations, I'm still here.

You know, I think your time is your time.

I think you sometimes
you can focus too much.

If you think too much
about your mortality,

then it's going to blur your vision.

You know, that's going to put
instill so much fear into you,

you don't even want to go do it.

So, it is a balance.

It's a balance of thinking that,
no, I'm not indestructible,

but I still need to complete this mission.

But where, you know, the training sort of

helps you mentally, you know that

you've been through the situations before.

You know you are one of the
best trained in the world

and you can do it.

And having a plan as well.

You know, for me, whether
it's the evacuations,

whether it's the bike ride, you, you know,

have a plan, be
comfortable with your plan.

But as I mentioned before, you know,

also be respectful of the fact that

it doesn't always go to plan.

And I think that's
where the Special Forces

and where I have I've done
really well is the fact that

I've had to react to situation
changes on the ground.

You know, before I deploy
somewhere to do evacuations,

you already have in your head a perception

of what it's gonna be
like when you get there.

And then when you actually get there,

it's like, okay, we
need to change the plan.

And so, so yeah.

So, back to your original
question, you know,

I'm not naive to think
that I'm an immortal.

I'm comfortable in the
fact that, you know,

in my training, having a plan

and yeah, I've been in situations

that I'm still here to tell the stories

where some of my friends aren't.

And so, I'm fortunate in that aspect.

- Yeah, you have like a
penchant for risk obviously,

is kinda what we're
talking about here too.

But I'm sure you've learned
how to mitigate a lot of that,

or at least approach it.

What is your approach to risk?

Like what to you makes a
smart risk worth taking

versus a dumb one?

Because you've taken some extreme risks.

- Yeah, I take some extreme risks.

You know, a lot of the stuff I do.

So, probably more so the
evacuations that I do,

you know, everyone sees,

you know, Hollywood doesn't help matters,

you know, I call it
the biceps, the bullet.

The biceps, the bullets and the bombs,

you know, it is almost like,

you know, it is all exciting
and it is blown off.

You know, I say that, you know, that's 25%

of what we do is what you see on the TV.

And that's always the last resort.

Actually 50% of what we
do isn't really that sexy.

It's all hearts and minds,
support and influences

being embedded with locals,

understanding demographics,
politics, tribal influences.

So, that's where my success
has been, is the fact that

I utilize as many local
resources as possible.

If I was trying to, again,
I'd be naive to say,

I'm gonna go into Israel,
I'm gonna go into Libya,

and get these these
people out without that.

So, for me, it's having a plan,

having those local
resources that help you.

And then some of the risks, you
know, it has to be balanced.

You know, I'm not gonna
take stupid risks at all.

The only time I would
take a risk, if there was,

you know, someone's life
was imminent, was at risk,

then I would have to make a decision,

which, you know, would
probably offset the balance.

But actually, you know, someone said,

you know, when you
leave the Special Forces

and go into the private security sector,

you've gone from being one
of the bravest in the world

to the biggest cowards.

Because actually a security guy

who ends up getting into trouble

hasn't looked at all
the potential options,

you know, in front of him.

You know, you need to, if
there's trouble over there,

why would you walk towards that direction?

You go around.

And so, yeah, we do a
lot of risk mitigation

and like I said, the only
time we would ever compromise

something like that is if someone's life

was imminently at risk.

- So, I imagine you've
turned down a number of jobs

just because it seemed too risky.

- I always like to look
at an alternative option.

You know, for example, the
Canadian embassy in 2014,

I single handedly evacuated

the Canadian embassy out of Libya,

18 military and four diplomats.

And, you know, all the
other security companies

couldn't come back in.

You know, I didn't need a big team.

I looked at the situation
we had on the ground.

We had to get from A to B, and
it wasn't actually that far.

It was the coastal road
from Libya to Tunis.

So, I got a fixer who
was from the local tribes

who spoke, came out.

We spoke to the tribal elders.

I didn't wanna bring any
attention to the group.

They had their diplomatic vehicles,

which should have safe passage through.

Their issue was all their
specialist equipment.

And so for me, I was like, well, how do we

get this specialist
equipment out undetected?

And so, they had from Tripoli
to Tunis, the Tripoli port,

you know, their fish wagons
every day doing that route

and just literally get
waved through customs.

And so, that's what I did.

I just got to the local fish wagons

and stuffed millions of dollars

of all their sensitive equipment in there.

So, we just looked at
in a different manner.

And also I think the week before

the British embassy got shot at,

every checkpoint between Tunis,

sorry, between Tripoli and Tunis.

And so I went out, I didn't
speak to the guys with the guns.

Me and my fixer, who's from Zuwara,

which is the border town to Tunis,

we went out and spoke to the tribal elders

and we just sat down with 'em

and we just explained who we
are, what our intentions were.

And it was just about
showing them a bit of respect

and a bit of communication.

And, you know, that's
what's managed to get me

through some of these hairy situations,

is the fact that don't try
and sneak around, you know,

the reason the British embassy got shot

is 'cause they hadn't
communicated with them

and they just drove through

the checkpoints at speed panicking.

And so, again, it's everyone's perception

or lack of knowledge of the regions.

And so that's where my
approach is slightly different.

- And you had, had previous
experience in Libya,

so you knew a lot of the local people,

the dynamics, the tribal
affiliations, and everything.

- Yeah, the tribe affiliations in Libya

it's very difficult to navigate.

There's 167 tribes in Libya.

So, my original one, back in 2012,

when you were American ambassador
got killed in Benghazi.

I was there that evening
and got an oil company,

a German oil company from
Benghazi back to Tripoli.

And again, you know, someone
without real knowledge

of the ground would probably say,

right, let's take the coastal route

and drive straight to Tripoli.

But you have to then go
through Misrata, Tripoli.

You've got guys and drivers from Benghazi,

and they're going to be your biggest risk,

not you yourselves as
Westerners is the fact that,

you know, it's these guys.

So, what I did with that one is

rather than taking the coastal road,

we headed south and I
had a safe house in Zella

out in the middle of the desert,

and we just lay up there for 36 hours.

And the reason we're
laying up there was to,

A, understand that local knowledge,

whereas other providers may just panic

and just take that coastal
route and end up in trouble.

So, yeah, understanding the demographics,

understanding the tribal influences,

and who's operating where,
and having the right fixers.

I must have about 15 fixers in Libya

all for the various, varying regions.

- How do you develop
like those relationships

and get the trust that you need?

That's gotta take, there's
cultural sensitivities

you gotta think about.

There's just, I mean, there
are 167 tribes in Libya.

Probably, some of 'em probably
don't like each other.

You said it's hard to navigate.

How do you even start to navigate that?

- So for me, what the way I do things,

is I tend to work on my own as well.

I keep a low profile.

A good example of this of trying

to establish these
relationships with Somalia.

I got asked to go into Somalia to help

one of the largest private
security companies in the world

was struggling to get
a footprint in there.

And so, everyone, when
I landed in Mogadishu,

everyone stays within the air base.

Well, I didn't, I just grabbed my bags

and just walked straight out the airport

towards the nearest hotel.

And you could see people look at me like,

'cause I obviously, I do stand out.

You know, I'm bald head, tattoos,

and like, you know, quite muscular.

And I think they were just in
shock, like, who's this guy?

But I got to the hotel, hotel manager

actually gave me an
AK-47 and a pistol said,

"You might need this."

I said, "Yeah, I probably would."

But you then get start to, you know,

people start to coming up to you.

You know, before I went in,

I obviously understood the
history of the country as well.

You know, I don't go in blind.

I do my own homework first.

And, you know, I was having meetings

and people like, it's
all about networking.

They said, oh, you speak to such a,

and I ended up meeting
a guy called al-Bashir,

and I'm sure he's French intelligence,

but actually he was from London.

Typical of all the places
we could have actually

done this back in London
rather than in Mogadishu.

But actually when him and I sat down

and you know, we had some dinner
on the beach in Mogadishu.

I got their respect, because he said,

well, they get emails all the
time from security providers

and they all offer the same services.

They're all ex-Special
Forces and things like that.

He said, "But you've taken the risk.

You've come here, you
know, you've come here,

you've sat across the table from me.

You now understand the
atmospherics of the country."

And so that's where I got a lot of respect

is the fact that rather
than doing it via email,

I would land in the country

and I would physically go see
these people face to face.

Because again, my perception of Somalia

and then what I actually saw

when I got there were
two different things.

And I go spearfishing off Mogadishu

and we cook lobsters on the barbecue,

but everyone obviously,
sees "Black Hawk Down"

and thinks that's their perception.

So, that's how I've managed
to build those relationships.

One common thread that I noticed,
like throughout your life,

you have these major decision points

and you tend to choose
the more challenging path.

Like when you first joined the military,

'cause your father was,
he was in the military,

but he was in charge of
sports, he was a coach.

And there was, that option
was available to you.

You could have easily followed that path,

but you chose not to.

You wanted to become a
paratrooper, I believe.

- Yeah, yeah, a commando, yeah,

- Yeah, and go into combat.

Then you chose to go
in the Special forces,

but it wasn't enough to
go in the Special Forces.

You had to pick like the harder way

to go in the Special
Forces through, you know,

instead of the normal route
that most guys did it.

It just seems like you,
when the path forks

and there's like, I don't
wanna call it the easy way,

but there's like the challenging way

and the more challenging way,

you seem to consistently opt
for the more challenging way.

And I'm just curious,
like, does that resonate?

And if so, like what drives
that? What motivates that?

- Yeah, so for me, I didn't have a plan

to be in the military, as you said.

I call my father the Ted Lasso.

He was the army soccer manager and coach.

But now I've seen Ted lasso.

He is nothing like Ted lasso,
nothing like Ted Lasso at all.

But he's what we call a tracksuit soldier.

So, his career, as you touched
on, was very sports oriented.

And my first year was the same.

As soon as they realized
my dad was Dave Stott,

I was in the Army soccer
team and doing the same.

And then like you said,

I've then joined the commando forces,

but I always had a, now, my
father told me going back

slightly at last two minutes.

And so for me, I always say, you know,

the best course of
action is action itself.

There's no point in arguing
with someone, you know,

because if they have their beliefs,

then you have your beliefs.

The only way you can prove 'em
wrong is by course of action.

And so I did, I joined the army,

and then once my dad realized

I was actually being quite serious,

he then supported me and
gave me some direction.

No, there's guys I was on selection with

who all they've ever wanted
to be from a young boy

at the age of six or
seven is Special Forces.

You know, they wanted to be a parachuter

or a commando and go SBS.

I always wanted to be a fireman.

I had no ambition of being
in the military at all.

It's just my life had sort of
put me in this position here.

I was on selection.

So, I never put myself under
any self-induced pressure.

It is what it is here I am.

And some of these guys were
coming off and failing.

You know, they'd reached, you
know, that time in their life,

you know, it's do or die.

And they were coming off and that was it.

They were devastated.

They would then leave the military.

So, for me it was like,
well, if I pass, I pass,

if I don't, I don't.

And yeah, I ended up becoming

one of the first Army guys to go SBS,

and I think now 15% of the
SBS comes from the Army.

- Do you consider
yourself a perfectionist?

- Yeah, I am, yeah.

Yeah, if I can, I'll try and
get, you know, I have an OCD.

- Yeah, yeah.

- I hadn't had it all my life.

I mean, it was something
in the military, you know?

I ended, unfortunately it
was a blip in my career.

I ended up in a military
prison for fighting

for 56 days, but I loved it,

because we had room inspections every day.

Everything was methodical.
It was in pairs.

I was like, this is amazing.

If I got paid to stay here, it is great.

You know, so, but my OCD seems
to have sort of worn off now.

And I have three kids, you
know, my first daughter,

I was literally around the
house, you know, picking her up.

But yeah, everything, like you
say, everything I like to do,

I like to try and do as much research.

And I understand that you
can't be a perfectionist,

but, you know, just try and, you know,

things don't always go plan
as I keep touching on so.

- What do you think is the most useful

or important thing that
guys learn in the military

that civilians don't have access to?

That it's like, man,
if everybody learn this

the way military guys learn this

or experience this the way
military guys experience this,

like the world would be a better place?

Like if it had to be one thing.

- Yeah, I don't even say one thing.

And I do a lot of guest speaking

and everyone's fascinated in
the corporate world, you know,

the battlefield to the
boardroom I call it.

And they understand your mindset.

I'm making these decisions
in these sort of situations.

And the thing is, that's
one thing the military

brings that no other organization
out there can replicate

is the scenarios and situations
that they put you in.

You know, whether you are
jumping into the Indian Ocean

to then go rescue hostages
or whether you are doing,

God knows, diving off a
submarine off the coast of Libya,

no one could do that.

So, for me, I think the real takeaway

I got from my time in the
military was my self-confidence.

I joined at the age of 17, I was 5'7"

and probably weighed about 130
pounds, you know what I mean?

So, physically I wasn't there,

but mentally, it was believing
that anything was possible.

And so, I'd probably say
that's the big takeaway.

For me, is that individual belief

that you're capable of doing it,

but also that teamwork, that comradery.

I think again, it's very
difficult to replicate

that in the civilian sector.

Yes, you may work with people at work,

you know, probably only
sort of similar scenario

is a professional sports team.

- Yeah.
- Is that,

and I think that's what's
lacked in the civilian sector,

which you do get from
the military, you know,

because we, you know, we literally

go to the toilet together,
we shower together,

we live together for months on end, yeah.

- And your lives depend on each other.

Like I think that's the
irreplicable thing is like

your life literally depends
on the guy next to you.

- Yeah, literally.

And as I said, you know,
when I'm on the ground,

you know, two things I think
about is mission success

and getting everyone
back on that helicopter,

because my guy in front of me,

I met his wife and his kids.

You know, we have barbecues
when we go back home.

So, it's not just, he's
not just my coworker.

I know everything about him as well.

And so, yeah, that's probably

what you can't really replicate
in the civilian sector.

Is that sort of that
brotherhood or comradery.

And I think that's where
a lot of guys, you know,

if you talk about mental health,

I think that's where a lot of guys

and girls struggle when they leave.

You know, you obviously
know the book "Tribe".

- [Mark] Yeah.

- You know, you've left this tribe,

you can't go back into
that tribe, you know,

what other tribe do you belong in?

And I had the same thing
when I got injured out.

You know, I had a huge identity crisis.

My guys were going to Afghanistan

and then I was going to physio.

I mean, I was now a civilian.

And so, really I'd sort of lost that,

you know, what is my
role? What is my purpose?

You know, how do I fit in society?

So, yeah, but you still,

I could call one of my
friends at any time now.

And it's almost like, you know,

if some of the guys hadn't
spoken to for six years,

but I could call 'em, it's like
we were chatting yesterday.

So, I think that's probably what lacks

in the civilian sector that
we get in the military.

- And would you say the
self-confidence piece

that kind of comes back to,

well, we were talking about
pain and experience before

of like, you get experienced
by having experiences.

Like, you know, the military
just puts you through

so many difficult experiences

that you can't help but develop
that confidence of like,

okay, I've been through
worse before, you know?

- Yeah, I think, you just can't help.

And it also has to be a bit
of self-confidence as well.

We used to get these annual reports.

They were like confidential
reports from your officer

and they'd tell you about how you're doing

and where you are with
the rest of the guys

and how you can advance in your career.

And I used to always have
the same comment every year.

There's a fine line between
confidence and arrogance.

And I was like, I said,

yeah, but if you're good, you're good.

But for me it was like, it's
almost contagious as well,

because if you are leading a team

and you are lacking a bit of confidence,

they're looking at you for direction.

And so, yeah.

It's sometimes, yes,
when you talk about fear

or self-induced pressure.

Yeah, there was times
that I did have that,

but I couldn't let my team see that.

You know, because they
see fear in you that,

you know, dissolve onto them.

And so, yeah, there was
an element sometimes like,

but then because you
were completing emissions

and you were achieving,

and yeah, there was an
element of, you know,

it's not arrogance, it was confidence.

And I think you have to be confident,

because you have any doubt then,

you know, doubt will creep in.

Then you won't be mission successful.

- Yeah.

- Well, and I think,

would you say too that
the military taught you

how to deal with extremes in a way?

Not just extreme situations,

but like you were saying,
you are a perfectionist

and you put yourself in situations

where your perfect plan is not

going to pan out.
- Yeah.

- And also, I mean, just things like

some stories I've read and heard from you

where you're in a very,
very tense situation.

But you have to be, you
can't let that anybody know

how freaked out you are
or anything like that.

So, dealing with extremes
within yourself too,

I think is probably a
skill that I know I don't,

I certainly don't have there.

When extremes come up in my life,

I tend to kind of just fall
apart a lot of times so.

- But the military's
great in the fact that,

'cause it is not all on your shoulders.

You've got the rest of the team.

So, what we do in the
military, the British Military,

is we train two up.

So, if you are a lands corporal,

you already know the job of a sergeant.

If you're a sergeant, you know the job of,

so should something happen, you know,

these guys already know
what to do as well.

So actually, you know,

if you've got the best team around you,

your job's quite easy, you know?

'Cause they already know
what you are thinking.

They've already done it.

You know, so that's the thing.

It's trying to be two, three
steps ahead of these guys

who are experts as well.

So, that sort of takes
the pressure off as well.

- Comes back to preparation.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- Just like an obscene
amount of preparation.

- Obscene amount of preparation, yeah.

And that's what I mean, you know,

what you see, you know,
the sexy stuff, you know?

So, all the training behind
the scenes, you know,

for us, we used to do two year,

it's like a two year rule
in the Special Forces.

And, you know, six months build up.

So, to Afghanistan or Iraq,
you do all your training then.

And then you also have
your own individual skills.

Whether you're a medic,

whether you're a JTAC brings in the jets

or you're a demolitions expert.

You know, you have to then

practice all your insurgent skills.

You are literally training
and training all the time.

And so, when it actually
comes to the operations,

you're like, thank God
we're actually here now.

It's almost a bit of respite,

because of the training
it's come before you

and then you come back from that tour

and then you're on the pager to deploy

anywhere around the world
through this situation.

And then we do counter-terrorism
hostage rescue.

But unlike the US, we actually
do homeland and overseas.

So, yeah, we got.

- So, you're like SWAT team and.

- SWAT team, yeah.

- And extractions.
- And the overseas as well.

I mean, before you know
it, you're then starting

the rotation to go back
out to Afghanistan or Iraq.

So literally, the training
behind the scenes is immense.

And you have to stay
current as well, you know,

'cause by the time you go
back out on your next tour,

you're probably outta date,

'cause some of these things are only valid

for about a year or maybe two years.

And so, yeah, so the training,

'cause it's training's so consistent,

it just becomes second nature,

just becomes second nature to you.

- This episode is brought
to you by BetterHelp.

BetterHelp is an online
counseling platform

that connects you to over
35,000 licensed therapists

based on your specific needs, location,

and what you prefer in a therapist.

BetterHelp really stands out
to me for a number of reasons.

First, you can choose your own therapist,

if you want someone who is professional

and won't swear like a
drunken frat boy like I do,

well, you can find that.

But hey, if you like cursing like a sailor

and somebody who will, you know,

maybe verbally rough you up a little bit,

I'm sure they've got that for you too.

Also, you can switch a
therapist at any time

in case you change your mind.

Second, it's super convenient.

Did you know that over 40% of the people

in the United States don't have access

to any mental health resources in person?

Yeah, that's a huge fucking problem.

And last, it's affordable.

And guess what? It's about
to be even more affordable.

Because if you go to Betterhelp.com

and use the code IDGAF that stands for,

I Don't Give A Fuck, you'll get 10% off

your first month of therapy.

That's Betterhelp.com/IDGAF.

I imagine a huge part of
succeeding in your industry

is just an intense lack of judgment.

Like, and I don't mean that in a,-

- Negative.
- that sounds bad way.

- Yeah, I know.

- No, but like, as an intense,

like lack of judging people based on

nationality, culture, ethnicity, gender.

Like you are dealing with
everybody from all walks of life,

from all backgrounds,
from all nationalities.

Probably extremely unique
personal stories as well.

And it just occurred to me that like

the ability to just
approach people as humans

and not see them as by, you know,

whatever label you wanna put on them.

- Yeah, it's true, yeah.

- It's like probably an underrated trait.

- Isn't underrated trait.

Alana says to people, "My
USP is I can make a friend

with anyone from any culture
anywhere in the world."

You know, I look quite intimidating,

but it doesn't put anyone off it.

I make friends all over the world.

And I think you're right, that's success.

Unfortunately, you know, people are quick

to tarnish a certain community,

because of something that was bad.

So, I take 9/11 for example.

No, 9/11, although quite
bad it was, you know,

everyone tarnishes that Muslim community.

But it's only a small, a
more minority that were bad

and there's small minorities
that are bad in every culture.

- Community, yeah.
- Every community.

- And so for me, I'm telling you about

some of these success stories.

None of these would've been successful

if it wasn't for those locals.

- Yeah.

- You know, and so I
understand the benefits of them

and how they can help
me and help the mission.

So, that's probably been, you know,

one of the big factors of this.

Is understanding and showing them respect.

And when I go to the,
some of these places,

I will sit on the floor, they'll offer me

a table with a fork and
a plate and a knife.

And I'm, "No, no, I'll sit with you."

And that goes a long way.

Whereas some others may not.

No, they may just be quite arrogant

and just sit at the table
with their knife and fork.

- Yeah.
- And so for me

it's understanding,
you know, the cultures.

And I do a lot of reading,

if I don't know, I'll ask before I go in.

But yeah, I've obviously been fortunate

to go pretty much all over the world now.

I think I've been over 110
countries around the world

and understand the differences
between the cultures.

You know, simple ones like,

and I also train as well travel security

for some of the corporates
and individuals.

Like for example, Saudi is
quite a sensitive place.

But you know, as long as
you know what you're doing,

people are worried about these places.

But you know, the only thing
that gets 'em in trouble

is their lack of knowledge.

You know, as we are seeing
in Turks and Caicos,

the Americans with
ammunition in their bags

or WNBA women taking marijuana, you know?

- To Russia, yeah.

- It is just individual errors,

which get people in trouble.

You know, if you take,

if you have a Bible in Saudi, that's fine.

If you have two Bibles, you're
a preacher you get arrested.

You know, it's just understanding

just little things like that.

So, I always say to people,

you know, don't worry about these.

You know, 'cause it can
be quite intimidating

when you go to some of these places,

You know, especially with the Middle East,

the way that they talk to each other

is quite loud and aggressive.

I used to pick people up from the airport

and I like, "What are they arguing about?"

Ooh. They're not arguing.

That's just the way they speak.

So, I always tell people my advice is

to do a little bit of research, you know,

and some of these websites .gov.uk,

the American equivalent,
and they have them on there.

They have cultural awareness on there.

I always say that to people is,

because that's the only thing I see

that gets people in trouble

is just the lack of cultural awareness.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- It also plays into like,
something that I found

living abroad for a number of years

and also just deeply believe
that like most people are good.

Anywhere in the world, any country,

any background, any religion,

like the vast majority of
people are just nice people

who wanna help out.

- And it tends to be the people

with not so much money as well-

- Yes.
- I find.

You know, Africa is probably
my favorite continent.

You know, they don't have much money,

but they are so hospitable.

When I did my bike ride,
actually, when I guest speak,

you know, I always get the
question, "Oh, what was it like?"

Because, you know, you
cycle through South America

and Central America and Mexico, Columbia.

Well, Colombians love cycling.

So, that was it.

You know, Mexico was it bad with a cartel?

And I was like, "No."

The only security incident
we had on that bike ride

was in Colorado Springs.

Someone broke into the support wagon.

You know, in Colorado.
- It checks out.

- So, I'm sort of like, when I put that

on the table, like really?

And so, but yeah, again,

it's the media monster that scares people.

And I think if you listen to
everything you see or read,

you know, you would never travel.

You never leave your front door.

- Oh, for sure.
- And so just

take a little bit.

Yes, and as you touched
on, there's bad people

in all communities.
- Everywhere.

- There's places in LA I won't go to.

You know, I was in New York

a couple of weeks ago at
a wedding. Oh, my word.

So, I felt safer down in
Yemen or in Mogadishu.

But, you know, and there've been

those beautiful places in America as well.

And I think everyone just
needs to really understand

that it's everywhere.

Everywhere has good and bad places.

- Yeah.
- Well, I'm sure you've had,

you know, these local relationships

that you've developed, so many of them.

I'm sure you've had some betrayal of trust

or something like that.

How do you deal with
that when that comes up?

- Touch wood, I've never had one.

- Really?

- Yeah, I've never had one.
- Really?

- Yeah, I've never had betrayal of trust

with foreigners working abroad.

No, nothing, no one's
really let me down until.

- Is that just because
you spent so much time

up front developing that relationship

and you've meted out every
little detail that you needed?

- Developing that relationship

and actually paying them
a decent wage as well.

- Ah, yeah.
- You know,

a lot of these security
providers will always look at

how they can, you know,

a lot of these big security companies

now are actually run by
accountants that's the problem.

And so, they're trying
to obviously cost cut.

So, for me, it's like, no, it's fair.

I will pay you, whether you're a Libyan,

whether you are from
Tunis or Guinea or Ghana,

I'll pay you the same as what I'll pay

one of my guys coming
in from UK or America,

which is huge for them.

- Yeah.
- And so you don't then get,

you know, 'cause there's
plenty of money to go around.

And they're not gonna betray you,

because they're onto a good thing as well.

And again, it's that
respect thing is that,

no, why would I pay you
any less than someone else,

if you are delivering the same product?

And so, yeah, that's what I tend to do.

So, I say I think where Alana and I

have been quite successful,

'cause as a husband and
wife, we are very nimble.

We make a decision straight away

rather than having to make
phone calls and pull guys in.

And so for us, it's just
we, 'cause we are nimble,

I'll fly in and we already
have people on the ground.

And so, you know, we'll just pay them,

you know, what they're due.

- So, speaking of Alana,

how has all of this affected
the relationship over the years

and how have you guys adapted to, I mean,

'cause you're traveling
all the time or at least

you were in the past.
- I was yeah, yeah.

- And you know, any given trip,

there's a possibility you don't come back.

So, I imagine-
- You have kids.

- you have kids.

So, I imagine that's
incredibly hard on her.

Like how did you guys navigate that?

- Yeah, like I say, everyone sees us now

and they're like the power
couple and things that, you know,

no, but that's 15 years
we've been together.

There has been ups and downs.

There's been mistakes along the way.

You know, I talked about, you
know, being home only 21 days

and really that was lack of communication.

You know, she thought I wanted to be away.

I thought she wanted me to be away.

And so, we again, we've made mistakes,

we've learned from those mistakes.

We don't sort of fall back
into that yin-yang off balance.

Everything we do is the
give back factor as well.

You know, even the bike ride,

you know, going away for so long.

You know, dad's gonna help children.

You know, so my daughter's, that's fine.

And so for me, it's just
literally a lot of communication.

And yes, there are sort
of dangerous situations

and if Alana says, no, then I
won't go, but she understands.

Alana's got such a big heart.

She's always wants to give back.

She sees the bigger picture
about helping people as well.

And so, really we are in a position

where if you have the capability to do it,

then I think you should do it.

You should always give back if possible.

You know, I'm very fortunate.

I have my skill sets,
Alana has her skill sets

and we can utilize them.

And what you don't wanna
do is just sit back

and hope someone else is
gonna pick it up and do it.

That probably won't happen.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

So, yeah, it is.

But it, like I said, it's been turbulent,

but we've now managed to
find an even playing field,

which works for us both.

- It sounds like getting
aligned on purpose

is a big part of that?

- Yeah, it literally, each
mission has to have a purpose,

'cause she works in the
human trafficking area.

The Haitian disaster not long happened.

And there was a woman there

and she was needing some security

and the price on her life
was only like $5 over there,

but they couldn't afford to
get any security providers in,

you know, they were a
nonprofit and stuff like that.

So, Alana's like, I
want to be in a position

where I can help people

and we can have the money to do that.

So, Alana trained, gave
up the banking, you know,

when I get injured, I said,
"We're working in security."

She's a close protection officer,

she's a surveillance operator,
she's done maritime security.

But what she did do,
she has an understanding

of the security sector
when it comes to planning.

So yeah, we both work
quite well on the things.

And you know, I'm very fortunate.

I do have a forgiving wife
in the fact that, you know,

she does let me go away for long times.

But as I said, it has to have a purpose

and a give back purpose as well.

So, and she sees that, yeah.

If you're not benefiting
someone or a community,

then we won't do it.

But there's also the fact that, you know,

you also have to support
your family as well.

- Of course.
- And so, you know,

so we've just gotta get that balance.

And sometimes we don't, you
know, my wife sort of jokes.

She's the, you know, she has a
book "How to Ask Some Money".

Now, and the reason
that book came about is,

you know, my bike ride, she got me

half a million pound
sponsorship as a non cyclist.

She raised $1.4 million for the charity.

She's not scared in asking for money.

But for me, and a lot of guys
in the military community,

you know, I joined the
Army at 17, left at 33.

You know, when I'm planning
operations, you know,

I need a UAV, I need a specter gunship,

I need three Black Hawks, I
need a squadron of 40 guys.

No one gives me a bill.

No one tells me what that cost,

- Budget.
- It's already done.

And so you come from that
environment to then leaving.

And I said, oh, and I generally,

believe everyone in the corporate world

was like the military. And
she's like, "Oh, no, no, no."

She is cutthroat.

So, Alana literally, I still
don't deal with any contracts.

Alana deals with all of that.

So, she works from that side of the house

and I work on the delivery.

- Yeah.
- But no, it works well.

When I said I was going
into business with my wife,

a friend of mine is like,
"That'll never work."

It might not work with his wife,

but it has worked out for us.

- Well, you guys have a
nice division of labor.

Like there's really clear roles

and it's like she has her
skillset, you have your skillset.

It sounds like there's
not tons of overlap.

Like you're both experts at what you do.

And so, there's like a nice synergy.

- Yeah, we understand our
strengths and weaknesses.

I don't get involved.

You know, she said, "I'm the one

who can schmooze clients," you know?

Clients like to talk to you,

but then when it comes to contract,

I just hand 'em to Alana, yeah.

And that's why I say, you
know, some of the clients

that we have, you know, some big names,

you know,, when they come,

they probably come to me
initially with their problem.

And then when we get
there, have the meeting,

I'll bring Alana, I'll say,

"Well, actually everything you need.

That's what Alana does
back at house, you know?"

Whether it's forensic
investigate stuff, due diligence,

you know, helping fix problems.
And then I sort of say,

"If you need me, and it's all gone wrong."

You know what I mean?

I've probably come a rescue.

- It also sounds like, I mean,
I don't wanna speak for her,

but it sounds like she knows
what she signed up for.

Like I run into, like,
I get a lot of emails

from people with relationship
or marriage problems.

And there I often see the
circumstance where it's like,

you know, I married a Special
Forces guy, he's never around.

He's always in war zones.

And it's like, "Well, yeah, you married

a Special Forces guy.

Like this is what you signed up for."

- Yeah, well, actually, when I met Alana,

she didn't even know the SBS was.

No, she did.

When I told her I was in the SBS.

You know, there's a
furniture company called SCS,

you know, deliver large sofas,
she thought was in the SCS.

Okay, that's fine.

And so she hasn't been,
you know, that didn't work.

But actually, you know,
when you speak to Alana,

she'll talk about when she
sort of fell in love with me.

When she sort of knew this was the guy.

So, when I met her in Aberdeen,

Aberdeen's like the oil
and gas capital of Europe.

it's like the Houston.

So very much, a lot of
oil and gas people come.

Now, we have 400 offshore platforms

off the coast of Aberdeen, yeah.

And so, very oil-driven,
male-dominant environment.

And, you know, she comes from a family

and a background where like
you stay in your own lane.

Now, she ended up being
a bank manager at 21,

and she's told she couldn't do
it, and it ends up doing it.

So, when I met her, I said,

"What is it you've always wanted to do?

You always been wanted to be in banking?"

She goes, "No, no, I've
always wanted to be a spy."

I said, "Oh." I said, "So,
what have you done about it?"

And she goes, "Oh, well,
you know, it's not for me."

And I was like, "Okay."

So next day, I turned up at the bank

with the MI6 joining instructions

and a phone number for a friend

who was actually doing recruiting for MI6.

I said, "Give this guy a call."

And she ended up, she went
through the whole process.

I think she got to the very last stage.

I think she failed on family history.

So, God knows what I've married into.

(everyone laughing)

- You still don't even know.

- You're still figuring
that one out, yeah.

- But for me, I mean, she then knew,

well, this guy is gonna push me.

And likewise, she pushes
me as well, you know?

You know, she found the
world's longest road.

I was thinking maybe east to west coast

of Scotland, you know?

She just finds the world.

So we actually, we work
well off each other.

Yeah, but that was the
turning point for like,

yeah, this guy's a bit different.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- I think that's really important

that pushing each other
within the relationship,

like trying to bring the
best out of each other.

- Well, and you both have such

a strong sense of duty
too, it sounds like.

I mean, you were wanted to be a fireman

and then join the military

and then she works with
human trafficking now,

and you guys have this whole thing.

Like, you have this very
strong sense of duty,

I think, to your just fellow human beings.

Is that kind of what drives you guys,

would you say a lot of this?

Like when you're in these crazy situations

that you put yourself in,

what is, is it that sense of duty

that you have to other people?

Or like you said, because I
can do it, I should do it.

- Yeah, I think it's an element of both.

There's a sense of duty,
but I, again, I think,

because we have the
capability of doing it.

You know, and we can make change

and then we should, you know?

And we are very honest that
if we can't make it happen,

if we can't make it work,

but then, you know, you
do know people who can.

You know, a good friend of mine said to me

when I first got out, he said,

"Dean," he goes, "when you
go into these meetings,

you know, if they ask you

if you can do it just say, 'Yeah.'"

He said, "And then afterwards, then you,"

because we do, we have
such a great network

of people who probably can.

And so for us, yeah, it
is that sense of duty

being able to, we have the
capability of doing it,

if not, we know someone who
else who could help you.

So, yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

- Nice.
- We love it.

- This episode is brought
to you by Momentous.

Did you know a shocking amount

of supplements at the grocery store

have bull shit ingredients added to them?

Like in some cases, 20 or 30 of them

don't even have everything
they say on the label.

And I forget exactly how much,

but they've even found hormones
in some supplement products.

Look, supplement purity matters.

It's a really important thing.

And that's why I use Momentous.

I use their creatine, their omega threes

and their protein powder.

These three are my daily go-to,

because, well, let's be honest,

they're kind of the only supplements

that actually have data showing they work.

I like Momentous, because it's different.

It's judged by top experts.

They only use the highest
quality ingredients.

Everything is pure.

And they invest heavily
in third party testing.

They meet the standards
of professional leagues,

such as the NFL and NBA.

And so, what's on the label

is exactly what's in the product.

There are no surprises,
just the good stuff.

So, if you wanna improve your
supplement game, like I did,

first one-time purchase.

That's LiveMomentous.com,

How did you meet Prince Harry?

- So, Prince Harry and
I were on a JTAC course.

A JTAC course is a forward air controller.

He drops the bombs from the jets.

And so, back in 2007, so he was young,

he was 23 at the time.

He was a young second
lieutenant, just joined.

Just come outta Sandhurst and
joined the Blues and Royals

and his unit were going to Afghanistan.

And so, he wanted to go
to Afghanistan as well,

you know, wanted to go with his guys,

but he's commanding officer was a ex-SAS,

Special Forces guy was like,

"Well, you can't just go to Afghanistan,

you need to have a role or a title.

So go away, do the JTAC course,

and you can be the regimental
forward air controller."

So, this course is in
RAF Leeming in Yorkshire.

And up there you've got the
eurofighter and the tornadoes,

all the RAF, all the top guns.

And then there's a little wooden hut

at the end of the runway,

which is where this course is
run, where the army are from.

And the Air Force pay no
attention to this little hut.

But this, the opening day, I turned up

and there was a lot of, I call 'em brass.

There was a lot of gold,-

- Yeah.
- gold stripes.

- Higher up.
- Higher ups.

Yeah, a lot of hierarchy
around here for some reason.

And I walked in the room and
there's 18 students, 18 seats,

and the four back seats
for the SAS and SBS,

two SAS, two SBS.

So, I took my seat look in front of me

and obviously, Harry sat there.

And every man and his dog came
in for this opening address

just to get some face time with him.

So, I was like, okay.

Anyway, he then leaves the room

And the sergeant major and
the course officer say,

"Look, you know who's on the course

and he gets no preferential treatment.

You treat him like one of your own."

I go, "Fine."

So, he comes back in the class

and the first lecture we
talk about is call signs.

So, on the course, they
give you a number jackpot.

So, jackpot one to jackpot 18.

So, the pilot then knows which student

he's talking to on the communications.

And then when you go to your units,

you get your own call signs.

So, mine was Mayhem 43 in the SBS,

where mayhem and then
whatever your number is.

And then the SAS is like Widowmaker.

So, Harry puts his hand up and says,

"Oh, you know, if
successful in this course,

do I get a call sign?"

And I just blurted out.

I said, "Yeah, you're Fox Piss 1."

Like, just kidding, you know?

And then, of course, everyone's face,

like jaws hit the ground, like.

You know, I was what?

And then, so he looked
around and he smiled,

he saw my beret and he smiled.

And then the afternoon
the sergeant Major said,

"Right, I've randomly picked
these jackpot numbers.

You'll be working with me

and the rest will be
staff sergeant whoever."

And he ended up picking four numbers.

And 14, I was like, "Well,
that's not an even split,"

but it ended up being me, Harry,

an SAS guy, and a RAF officer.

And then you then have to work
in pairs through the course.

So he said, "You're with Harry,"

'cause he knew I would
treat him as one of our own.

And I didn't see him as a royal member.

I did see him as a member
of the royal family,

but I wasn't acting like that around him.

I just saw him as a young officer.

And yeah, he was a competent JTAC.

He was good on the radio, he was great.

And then, yeah, we then just
maintained that relationship.

And I used to do a lot of stuff

for the Special Boat
Service, our nonprofit.

He would come to do some events there.

Then when I ended up getting
injured out the military,

you know, I had an
intelligence fusion cell

based in Mozambique in Tanzania,

and we'd help identify
the smuggling routes

of the ivory from Africa to Asia.

And so, I would always
send that to him as well.

So, we had that
relationship post-military.

It wasn't until the bike ride really

that sort of relationship
came out in the public domain,

'cause it was actually, he
was the first person I rang

when Guinness had said,
you've been successful.

I said, "Oh, I'm gonna cycle
the world's longest road."

I said, "What charity
should we do it for?"

And him and his brother and Kate

were just about to launch Heads Together,

which is a mental health campaign.

And so, yeah, that was the one

we raised the $1.4 million for.

- Yeah.
- And so, yeah,

that's when it then became apparent

that you and this guy
are friends and, yeah.

And here we are now, you know,
17 years on still friends.

He is only up the road, you
know, things have changed.

When I met him 2007, I
didn't even know Alana then.

And you know, and he clearly
didn't know Meghan at the time.

So, we've known each other as single guys

and we've grown up
together, both got married.

You know, I was fortunate to
go to their wedding as well

and see each other have grow families.

- I noticed this when I was
working with Will Smith,

like people, there's a certain
level of fame or status

that makes most, like
when they are in the room,

most people's brains just
like, people lose 20 IQ points.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- And it's, as somebody who's just kind of

fascinated with psychology,

I found it endlessly interesting to watch.

But I'm curious, A, how that plays into

kind of thinking about
security and your role.

But I'm also, I don't know,

one thing that I noticed with him

and some of the people that
he used to hang around with

is that like, there's
actually a skill to that.

Like, there actually is, there is a reason

why they picked you to go with him,

because some people don't seem
to be able to turn that off.

- Yeah, yeah. No. So,
I've witnessed it before.

I've seen people just,
their whole attitudes change

when they come in the room.

I'm like, what are you doing?

Yeah, just be normal.

And I think that's what Alana said did

like I will speak to a child on the street

the same as I would speak to
a royal member of the family.

There's no in between,
and that's the thing.

I think that's where it
is quite unique to me.

I will speak to 'em like,
so I'm not phased by that,

but I have seen it
before and I just, yeah.

I think as you rightly
said, they pick up on that.

They know that.

And that's one great thing about Harry.

And I remember doing a promo
video for the bike ride,

and we did it in Kensington Palace.

And this guy Mark, who was
running the whole production,

and we had four cameras.

And then Harry walked in the courtyard,

Mark almost like, jumped
to attention as a civilian.

I was like, "Whatcha doing?"

I was like, "Calm down, mate."

But what Harry was great, and
because they pick up on it.

Harry, before we did anything,

he went round and spoke to everyone.

- Yeah.
- Spoke to every cameraman,

spoke to everyone behind the scenes,

and they introduced himself,

and literally just put them all at ease.

- Yeah.
- So, they know it,

they sense, no doubt
Will senses it as well.

You know, some people aren't the same

when they're in front of people,

but for me, yeah, I don't have a filter.

I'm just like, you are, you know?

And for him, you know, that family,

going back to your question,
and they were born into that.

That's a hard life to be born into.

They were constantly under the spotlight.

And I think that's where
I saw Harry at his best,

because he's not comfortable
in speaking in public.

He's admitted he doesn't like that.

And so, he was most
comfortable in the military,

because he wasn't being judged

as a member of the royal family.

He was being judged as being
an officer in the military.

You know, if you've got things wrong,

you've got things wrong.

If you've got things right,
you've got things right.

- Yeah.
- So, but yeah,

I think they do pick up on those things.

- And I think that skill goes both ways.

That's the other thing I like,

Will there is a skill to being famous.

- Yeah.
- Like what you just said,

like knowing to go around,

introduce yourself to the cameraman.

Knowing how to speak, you know,

like understanding that your words

are gonna have more weight

or gonna be interpreted in different ways.

And what I've noticed, just being around,

I guess some of the higher profile people

that I've been around is that some people

seem very naturally disposed to that,

like they have the personality for it.

Like Will has the personality for it.

He loves people, he loves chatting

and schmoozing with people.

Like it's fun for him.

Some people it's not fun for.

And like, and it feels like pressure,

it feels like work, it
feels like judgment.

And so, I mean, coming back to
the Crown, it's interesting,

because it's like you
said, they're born into it.

And I imagine some of
them they handle it well.

Like, you know, it's a personality thing.

Some of them are just
kind of built to like,

you know, this is no
problem, this is part of it.

And some of 'em are
like, this is terrible.

- Yeah, but the probably the
biggest difference there,

like Will probably doing it, you know,

and you know, financially, you know,

he's there for real, you know, he's gonna,

they have to do it as a duty.

They're not getting paid for it.

And they would do four or five a day.

And to keep that smile going
for four or five times a day,

you know, that's hard work.

You know, that's probably
the big difference for them

is they're not financially gaining,

they're doing it as a duty,
as a role as a purpose.

And so, that's the difficult one, yeah.

- Well, that goes back a little bit.

- If I was getting
paid, I'd smile all day.

- I'll shake anybody's hand whatever.

- Yeah, yeah.

- That's that duty thing though.

It goes back to, I didn't really get

the whole royal family thing

as an outsider looking in and everything.

But I heard Ricky Gervais
one time talk about

how, you know, the prime minister

has to go before the King

or Queen every single week.

And that has to be somewhat of

a humbling experience for them.

Whereas, you know, like we see

the President in the United States,

it's, you know, they flout Congress,

they're like, whatever.

- There's humbling the
President of the United,

- There's nothing humbling them.

And that made a lot of sense to me.

I was like, it just keeps it
in historical context for them.

And puts it into context where
they have to be a part of

something that's much larger
than themselves, I guess.

- There's an institutional
aspect of that as well.

I remember, so I studied
geopolitics in college

and like international relations.

And I remember I took a class

and there was a class on
kind of English system

and like the constitutional monarchy.

And the professor was saying, he was like,

he said one thing that's unique,

was unique about Queen
Elizabeth was, you know,

you can have a new prime minister come in,

he thinks he's hot shit.

He's got all these ideas, you know,

and he explains it to the Queen.

And she's like, "Well, you know
what Winston told me once,"

you know, like, just starts
pulls out the Churchill card

and is like, yeah, you're not that smart,

- Probably prime minister number 11.

Don't worry about that, yeah, yeah.

But I think with the royal family

and I talk about, you know,
it's difficult for 'em,

because I think it's great
keeping that history there,

you know, that is very important.

But obviously, times are changing
and quite quick, you know?

And so, really it's finding that balance.

And sometimes they've been
criticized that before,

because you have the old suits.

- [Mark] Yeah, of course.

- Like this is the way we do it,

but then you have to
have the modern world.

That was why I think like, you know,

if I remember rightly,
like Queen Elizabeth

did like the first ever
email, didn't they?

And they did the first ever like, radio.

- Or yeah, her father
did the radio broadcast.

- Radio broadcast.

You know, they've done a lot
of things, which for the first,

and so, that's why I think
likes of William and Kate

will be great when they
come in and take over,

'cause he need to almost like
modernize the royal family.

- Or give royal TikToks.

- Yeah, exactly, there
has to be a hard balance.

Yeah, yeah so.

- [Mark] You just had a
Netflix show come out.

- Yes.
- Tell us about that.

- Yeah, so I think you and I,

I think we probably met each
other nearly three years ago.

- You were just starting it.

- Just starting, yeah.

So literally, from the initial phone call

to where we are has been over three years.

So yeah, Netflix show is called
"Toughest Forces On Earth".

And the best way to describe it

it's almost like "Top Gear" with guns.

- [Mark] Okay.

- But we can't call it Top Guns.

- That was taken.
- That was taken, yeah.

And literally, it is myself
and two American co-hosts.

And we go around the world

visit eight Special Forces
units from around the globe.

And we showcase what's unique about them,

whether geographically
where they're placed,

the threats to the country,

environments that they operate in,

you know, different weapons systems

and sort really just gives
people an understanding

of other units around the world

and some of the other
capabilities that we do,

'cause people don't really get to see

everything in the Special Forces.

So, for me, I'm 47 years old, you know,

I got injured out, you know,

I didn't think I was gonna
be falling through the ice

or, you know, abseiling
out helicopters again.

So for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it,

but it gives people an
idea of the militaries

and I mean all the other skill sets

that you have and that it brings.

But also recruitment.

Recruitment's at an all
time low around the world,

apart from the US Marine Corps, I think.

- Interesting one.
- The only one

who's hitting their mark.

- What was your favorite of the eight,

there's eight of them, right?
- [Dean] Eight of them, yeah.

- Which was your favorite?

Which was the hardest, and
which was your favorite?

- So, we filmed in USA,
Columbia and Mexico,

Austria, Sweden, Jordan,
Philippines, and Malaysia.

So, we went all the way around the world.

Now, the hardest thing for
me, I was very fortunate.

Everything we did we
filmed I'd done before.

The only thing I hadn't done before

was the swamp survival in Malaysia

where we literally were
there in a pair of shorts,

a weapon, and just got covered in mud.

And so, that was a new experience for me.

So, there was nothing that
stood out that was hard.

What was hard for me was the transition

going from one country to another.

Literally, we were doing
arctic survival in Sweden,

and then next one we're
in Columbia in the jungle.

So, we're from minus 30 to plus 30.

- Oh my gosh.
- And so that,

and then dealing with
the time zones as well.

So, that was difficult for me,

but a lot of it was
refreshing and revision.

But for me, what I really took away

was that you still had it, you know,

that muscle memory hadn't gone too long,

needed a day or two,

and then you're just almost
like back in the teams.

Which is great, whereas for Cameron,

you know, Cameron the
least experience of us all,

and a lot of these were new firsts to him.

He'd never dived before, he'd
never put skis on before,

you know, and things of that.

So, that was a great,
great experience for him.

- Nice, Dean Stott. Still got it.

(everyone laughing)

- I was slightly worried,

I do pick up a military
pension for being injured,

not being able to run.

And I end up beating
them two on the sprints.

I'm like, "Oh, don't
take my pension back."

(everyone laughing)

- Nice, man.

Well, thanks, dude.

I'm thrilled for you.

I'm glad the show came out

and everybody should check out the book.

Anything else you wanna promote?

I know you say you don't have a website.

- No, we don't.

I have a website, it's deans.com.

- You have a website?
- I have a website.

- The security business
does not have a website.

- I've actually put a
security page on there.

So, you know, if people need to get out,

whether it's get in touch with,

whether it's through security,
they can find me on there.

You know, as I said to you earlier,

you know, the world only
sees 30% of what we're doing

and 70% of what we're not.

But for me, I have another
challenge coming up next year.

I'm ocean rowing the west
coast of the Americas,

has never been done before.

But we're gonna start in
Vancouver and finish in Tijuana.

And so, we've done charities, you know?

Human trafficking we touched on,

with veterans, you know, mental health,

you know, we've done all that.

This one's gonna be
for ocean conservation.

- [Mark] Okay.

- And to really highlight
the issues there.

And so, next summer, so I've
just bought a rowing machine

and then next summer I'll row
the west coast of America.

But the difference on this one,
Alana's gonna be joining me.

Alana's done no, as in she has done

no sport in her entire life.

And she gets upset, because
when I did the bike ride,

a lot of people are like, "Well,
of course, he could do it.

He's Special Forces."

Well, I know 99.9% of Special
Forces couldn't do that.

And so it all gets overlooked,

because you're a Special Forces,

people assume you're a super human.

And so, what I'm doing with
this is I'm taking someone

who literally is a level playing field,

never done anything before.

And then, we're doing it with her.

So, it'll either be her
or be one of my kids.

Depends how busy we get, yeah.

- For the whole way?

- For the whole, yeah.

Which is why we're gonna do
it during the summer holidays.

- Okay, and it's what?

You're rowing and she's
sitting in the back.

- Well, no, she can row as well.

It's a two seater, it's
a two seater rower, yeah.

But it has this big cabin.

- A mai tai.

- Yeah, it has a cabin
where you can sleep.

It has a cabin which has
all the communications

and the navigational stuff,
and have the solar panels.

And so, she'll probably
just be on her laptop

just doing all the work.

And I'll just row.

But no, no, she likes to,

I think she sees this as a good challenge.

This has taken her out her
comfort zone, you know?

I've been outta my comfort zone a lot.

I think her doing it with me,

she'll feel comfortable that I'm there.

That, you know, there's
someone who's capable.

And I was fortunate to do my yacht masters

and everything in the SBS.

I have all those sort of
seamen cards that we need.

So, but yeah, it'll be interesting.

You know, that'll be a big test, you know.

A few weeks in the boat

with your wife.
- In more ways that one.

For sure.
- Yeah.

- But no, yeah, keep an
eye out for that one.

- Amazing. All right, man.

Well, we look forward to it.

- No, thank you so much.

- Thanks for coming in.

- Thanks, Dean.
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

- Yeah, yeah.

(upbeat music)

(upbeat music continues)
